# Knives

<p class="title"><img src="Knives.jpg" /></p>

## What are we even doing?

You have a super simple RPG in front of you. All you need are some
friends and two regular six-sided dice, maybe some pen and paper, and
you're good to go. One of you will referee the game. Is that you? All
other players think up a person. The referee dreams up a world and
situations for these imaginary people; the players say how they react
and the referee says how the world reacts, and so it goes on and on.
The story of these people is our story.

The dice are rolled when something with exciting consequences happens
and we want to leave the outcome to chance. Do our people succeed in
their project or not? And what happens afterwards?

This is a variant of the *Halberts* game where your character doesn't
start fully fleshed out. Instead, you start as a young adult, with
nothing but a knife. And you're not trained in knife fighting.

## Character Creation

If you are a player, you play a fictional person, your character.

First you choose your name, then you roll your attributes. You have
six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence,
Education, and Status. Roll two six-sided dice for each attribute, add
them together (short: 2d6) and write it down.

> Example: Alex names his character Adalric and rolls 8 8 7 9 10
> 8; Berta names her character Brunhilde and rolls 10 6 9 5 4 4.

Your character begins at age 16. You have no special talents. If you
want to begin the game with more experience, take a look at the
*Halberts* rules.

Your first job will be to make friends and connections.

## No money, no items

The only item of significance you own is a knife. In fact, the only
items of significance in this game are weapons: knife, spear, halberd,
épée, bow, lance.

The world of adventure is a medieval world beyond the reaches of
empire. There are no taxes to pay, no coins to earn and nothing to
buy. Everything is a question of *gifts* and *boons*. Make friends and
perhaps they’ll give you a gift, hoping for a gift in return. Render a
service to a powerful person and hope to be granted a boon. If you
find treasure, gift it to somebody with resources. You might make a
powerful friend.

### Gifts and boons

**Talent**: With every year that passes, you get to gain new skills.
Naturally you’re just not focusing on a single skill. The year is
long, after all. This is why you get to pick an appropriate table to
roll on during the winter phase. You’ll get one of the skills on the
list, but chance still plays a role.

**Weapon**: Join a militia and get a spear to fight with. Go to war
and you’ll be given a halberd. Rise to the rank of nobility and your
lord or lady gifts you an épée. Become a hunter and make your own bow.
Be knighted and get a lance and a horse.

**Secret Society**: Secret societies are always looking for new
members. There are secret societies for all walks of life. If they are
are crime rings, they’re looking for gangsters and thugs. If they are
guilds, the are looking for artisans. If they are magic schools,
they’re looking for mages. Prove your worth and you’ll be allowed to
join.

**Companion**: A young apprentice looking to learn from you, or an
intelligent animal such as a cat, an owl, or a raven. If your
companion is human, roll the six attributes (2d6 each for Strength,
Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, and Status).

**Dog**: Adventuring might lead you to find a loyal friend. Damage
2d6; Endurance 3d6; Life 2d6.

**Horse**: Knighthood earns you a loyal mount from your liege. Riding
a horse allows you to wield a lance. The horse requires care and
feeding. Damage 3d6; Endurance 6d6; Life 3d6.

**Land**: Saving the life of a noble or winning a war with them might
get you a grant to a piece of land in the wilderness. Taking
possession of said land is up to you, of course.

**Chair**: Your skills as a mage have been recognised and a sponsor
offers you a teaching position at a magic school.

**Posts**: Your services to a community, be it gangsters or
administrators of the realm are recognised and once there’s a position
for you, they’ll think of you.

## Talents

We roll checks as follows: 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent. On very hard
tests: 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent. If no talent fits, or the matching
talent is missing, then +0.

## Gaining talents

With every year that passes, you get to gain new skills. Pick an
appropriate table to roll on during the winter phase and gain the
skill or increase the skill if you already have it.

When you learn "Fighting", choose a weapon instead: knife, spear,
halberd, épée, bow, lance. Note that you do not start with the Knife
skill even though you own a knife.

If you’ve spent the summer doing warrior things, pick one of the
following tables to roll on.

## Adventurer's Life

If you want to do something and the outcome is uncertain, discuss with
the referee an attribute and a talent to use, provided there is a
suitable match. Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If it's very
hard, you might have to roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent.

If you attack successfully, you deal 2d6 damage unless you use a
halberd. This deals 3d6 damage. You can only attack as many times in a
fight as you have Endurance.

When you are first hit in combat, you must subtract the damage from a
random physical attribute. Roll 1d6: 1–2 is Strength, 3–4 is
Dexterity, 5–6 is Endurance. For all other hits, you may distribute
the hit dice yourself among the three physical attributes. You must
subtract any carryover from another physical attribute.

If one of your attributes drops to 0, you are slightly injured and
pass out. After 10 minutes you wake up again.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength 10, Dexterity 6, Endurance 9. She
> gets hit for the first time and has to subtract 4+5=9 damage. Berta
> rolls a 1, so Brunhilde must subtract 9 from Strength (10-9=1). She
> won't pass out! The second time she has to subtract 2+6=8 hits and
> chooses to subtract 2 from Dexterity (6-2=4) and 6 from Endurance
> (9-6=3). Now it's getting close…

After the fight, all attributes recover half of the missing amount
(round down). If you are being treated by First Aid or a healer, you
will be fit again in 30 minutes, otherwise the recovery will take 3
days.

> Example: After being treated with First Aid, she recovers.
> Brunhilde's attributes: Strength 1+4½=5, Dexterity 4+1=5, Endurance
> 3+3=6.

If two of your attributes drop to 0, you are severely wounded and pass
out. You don't wake up again for 3h and only the attributes from 0
recover to 1. With First Aid-3 or Healing-3 you can recover in an
infirmary in 5d6 days, otherwise you die.

If three of your attributes drop to 0, you die.

For all other creatures there are only Endurance and Life instead of
the known six attributes. When Endurance drops to 0, they faint; when
Life drops to 0, they die.

> Example: Adalric's dog Tix has Endurance 3d6, Life 2d6. Alex rolls
> 1+4+5=10 and 5+2=7 and writes down 10/7 for the dog.

Hitting opponents wearing a metal cuirass is hard: roll 3d6 ≤
attribute + talent. The reason metal cuirasses are so rare is that
they are so hard to make. They are kept in armories for times of war.
You only put them on when marching into battle. They slow you down
when plundering and when fleeing; they are cumbersome to carry around
and they give you sores. Soldiers do not like wearing them.

## Opponents

All other chapters in this book are intended for the referee. So for you!

People can be depicted with the well-known six attributes. You may
choose these freely or roll them (2d6). Talents are also freely
determined (often 1 or 2).

Monsters and animals have different characteristics that describe
their behavior: damage determines how much damage they deal if they
hit; endurance determines how many rounds they will fight and how much
damage they can take; if it drops to zero, they faint; excess damage
is substracted from life; if it drops to zero, they are mortally
wounded; attack determines whether they attack in an encounter (2d6 ≤
attack); hit determines how well they hit (2d6 ≤ hit), and escape
determines if they attempt to escape when they’re not attacking (2d6 ≤
escape). If they neither attack nor escape, we talk.

| 1d6 |  Opponents | Damage | Endurance | Life | Attack | Hit   | Escape |
|:---:|-----------:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| 1   | Nightlings | 2d6    | 1d6       | 1d6  | 1d6+4  | 1d6+5 | 1d6+3  |
| 2   |  Predators | 2d6    | 3d6       | 2d6  | 1d6+5  | 1d6+6 | 1d6+2  |
| 3   |     Undead | 2d6    | 3d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+6  | 1d6+7 | 1d6+0  |
| 4   |     Mounts | 3d6    | 6d6       | 3d6  | 1d6+4  | 1d6+4 | 1d6+2  |
| 5   |     Giants | 4d6    | 8d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+3  | 1d6+8 | 1d6+0  |
| 6   |    Dragons | 6d6    | 10d6      | 5d6  | 1d6+2  | 1d6+9 | 1d6+0  |

For each world, the stats will be slightly different. Note down when
you roll something and stick to it! For the number of enemies, roll
2d6 for nightlings and predators, or 1d6 for undead. Giants and
dragons are always loners.

> Example: Claudia referees the game and needs goblins that
> ride on giant spiders that ambush the vanguard. There are 7.
> She uses the line of nightlings and mounts. Goblins:
> Damage-3, Endurance-1, Life-5, Attack-5, Hit-9, Escape-4.
> Giant Spiders: Damage-15, Endurance-16, Life-12, Attack-9,
> Hit-5, Escape-7. In this world, goblins are rather harmless
> opponents who ride on terrible giant spiders, which,
> oddly enough, are not very good at hitting things.

Always announce impending danger clearly, so that the players can
decide for themselves whether they want to engage in a fight.

> Example: Claudia describes how the car-sized shadows
> push through the undergrowth, how their acrid smell spreads
> and the animals in the barn panic.

If possible, the players should roll the dice, not the referee. For
example, if they want to lure the opponent into an ambush, or notice
an ambush, someone should roll against Intelligence + Tactics in both
cases.

## Magic

Just like you slowly build up a pool of enemies, you need to work out
an understanding of just how powerful magic is with the players.

> Example: How many goblins can Adalric kill with lightning? Alex and
> Claudia agree that lightning can hit a giant spider including its
> rider, doing 5d6 damage to each, or chain lightning can hit five
> goblins, doing 2d6 damage to each.

The same applies here: Make a note of what you negotiate and stick to
it!

> **Lightning**: hits an enemy and what they are carrying for 5d6 damage each  
> **Chain Lightning**: hits up to 5 enemies for 2d6 damage each

Since spells are stronger than weapon attacks, one shouldn't be able
to cast any number of them. With each spell cast, the risk of
exhaustion increases. Therefore, when casting spells, the modified
rule applies: roll 2d6 + number of spells cast today ≤ attribute +
talent to succeed. If the check fails, the talent can no longer be
used today.

> Example: Adalric conjures rain for privacy. He has Education 9,
> Water-1, making a total of 10. Alex rolls 10 + 0 since this was the
> first spell of the day. It's raining because 10 ≤ 10. Chain
> Lightning follows: Alex rolls 5+1=6 and 6 ≤ 10. That kills five
> goblins.

Magic always leads to discussions. You have to like that – otherwise
you should skip the Mage career. How long can you breathe underwater?
Can you do magic underwater? What happens when you cast lightning
underwater? The important thing is to agree at the table and to write
down the result.

Not all magic talents are equally powerful, or equally useful. You
also have to live with that. Certain magic talents lend themselves to
druids, bards, healers.

There is no talent for summoning: instead, this is meant to be handled
with a gate to another plane, or as a planeswalk. You have to
subjugate every demon yourself and force it to do its deeds.

In my games, Charm is always a violent thing: being forced into things
is nauseating and revolting.

It is not possible to foresee the future. That would incapacitate
players. A role-playing game is not a saga; fate is not predetermined.

## Combat

Combat is divided into rounds. Everyone may attack, cast magic, or do
something else once per round. All participants announce their action,
roll the dice and evaluate. Everything happens at the same time.

> Example: Adalric casts chain lightning and he is protected by the
> rain. A goblin has seen him anyway and shoots at him with his bow.
> The goblin has attack 5. Claudia rolls 6 – and 6 ≰ 5: misses!

In some role-playing games, combat tends to be front and center. In
this game, after one round, perhaps half of those involved are already
on the ground. War is terrible. Most of the time it's about avoiding
the fight.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength 10, Dexterity 6, Endurance 9, and
> Fighting-1. She tries to reach the farm, but two goblins are hot on
> her tail, with Damage-3, Endurance-1, Life-5, Attack-5, Hit-9,
> Escape-4. She turns to fight. First round: Berta rolls 6 and hits
> because 6 ≤ 10+1. Claudia rolls 5 and 6 for the goblins and hits
> twice since 6 ≤ 9. With the first hit, chance decides which
> attribute Brunhilde must reduce: Berta rolls a 4, which is Dexterity
> (6-3=3). The goblins deal 3 every time they hit. The second hit
> Brunhilde deducts from her Endurance (9-3=4). Berta rolls 6 damage
> which kills the goblin (both Endurance and Life are reduced to
> zero), but the other still stands.

When an advantage is gained through tactics, the result is often a
surprise round where the opponent cannot strike back. That can become
very important.

## Adventures

There is an adventuring season. People go on the adventure in summer, then they return home, work the fields, bring in the harvest, cut wood, help build their communities, raise a barn, study.

Pay attention to the inter-generational game. Raise a family. Play your relatives and children. Get a land grant. Build a castle. Defend it against invasion. Build a community. I would love to see this work!

This needs tons of ideas for a social setting with lords and ladies, secret societies, magic schools, gangs of thieves, mercenary bands, each with missions you can undertake for them, services you can render for them, big and small. Each comes with rewards. Whenever you roll the Fighting skill, you get granted an appropriate weapon, if you don't have it already.

* Bring back the horses the men of Amalgard of Bearhall stole. If you do it, roll on the Thief or Mercenary list.
* Bring these donkeys and their load to Falconthorpe. If you do it, roll on the Guard. If you befriended Chrodotrud, you may roll on the Passive list instead.
* Go to the ruins of Frosthall and see if you can catch an Owl-wolf for Siggo the Aeromant. If you do it, roll on the Mercenary or Aggressive table. If you decide to spend the winter in Ramdale, receive a dog companion instead.
* Join the raid against Amalgard of Bearhall. If you do it, roll on the Mercenary table. If you helped steal any horses, you may keep one.
* Falconthorpe has been struggling with a manipulator. If you manage to drive him away, roll on the Mercenary table. If you decide to spend the winter there, in his house, studying the books, roll on the Manipulative or Transgressive table and tell us what sort of books you read.

What about treasure? If you find the Book of Redemption for Bishop Gregor, you can become a member of the secret society of the Librarian Militia of the Moon. There's no point in getting rich yourself. The treasure you find allows you to barter for boons: land grants, titles, marriage proposals, memberships in knightly orders, secret societies, and so on. Those would also be part of the setting and adventure book.

Don't write a setting with a timeline, a map, and names. Instead, write a pamphlet. Describe what to aim for, how to do it, with random tables to help you get started. More names. More missions. More treasure. More monsters. Conflicts with neighbours. Invaders. Unrest. Rebellions. Cultists. Wars. Tables. Tables. An essay or two. More tables.
