## What are we even doing?

You have a role-playing game (RPG) in front of you. All you need are
some friends and two regular six-sided dice, maybe some pen and paper,
and you’re good to go. One of you will referee the game. Is that you?
All other players think up a person. The referee dreams up a world and
situations for these imaginary people; the players say how they react
and the referee says how the world reacts, and so it goes, on and on.
The story of these people is our story.

The dice are rolled when something with exciting consequences happens
and we want to leave the outcome to chance. Do our people succeed in
their project or not? And what happens afterwards?

The first ten pages contain the player facing rules and an example
character sheet. The rest of the book is advice for the referee.
Hopefully, this is you!

## Character Creation

If you are a player, you play a fictional person, your character. For
the purposes of this game, your character is “you”.

First you choose your name, then you roll your attributes. You have
six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence,
Education, and Status. Roll two six-sided dice for each attribute, add
them together (short: 2d6) and write it down.

> Example: Alex names his character Adalric and rolls 8 8 7 9 10
> 8; Berta names her character Brunhilde and rolls 10 6 9 5 4 4.
{ #stats }

Your character begins at age 16. Now you choose a first career. The
choices are Warrior, Mage, or Rapscallion. The process is always the
same: when you begin a new career, make a test to see if it suits you;
get an automatic talent if it does, learn talents, possibly suffer a
twist of fate and grow older by four years. And then you have to
decide if your character continues in the same career for another four
years, with no more suitability test and no automatic skill; or if you
use one year to change careers, risking a new test of suitability, but
also getting a new automatic skill; or if your character is ready for
a life of adventure.

Depending on the career, certain attributes are advantageous. Warriors
need Strength or Endurance, Mages need Intelligence or Education, and
Rapscallions need Dexterity or Status.

If your character isn't suited for the desired career, that career can
no longer be selected. When there are no more careers to choose from,
the adventurous life begins: roll on the reward table for each career!

A career lasts for four years. Each year, choose one of your career
charts and roll 1d6. Write down that talent with a value of 1, or
increase the value if you learn a talent again. When you learn
“Fight”, choose a weapon instead: knife, spear, halberd, épée, bow,
lance.

With every career your character completes, the chance for a twist of
fate increases. Thus it makes perfect sense to stop character
generation at some point and to start adventuring.

If your character is 36 or older at the end of a career, you'll need
to check for physical decline. If an attribute falls to zero, the
character dies.

| 1d6 |     Aging Table |
|:---:|----------------:|
| 1   |     Strength -1 |
| 2   |    Dexterity -1 |
| 3   |    Endurance -1 |
| 4   | Intelligence -1 |
| 5   |          Lucky! |
| 6   |          Lucky! |

## Warrior Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Strength or Endurance (your choice). You
automatically learn Fight-1 if you pass. If you don't, you realize
that killing people is brutal and cold and you are not.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength 10 and Berta rolls 2. Brunhilde is
> accepted!

You spend four years as a Warrior and learn something every year. Each
year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6. You may only
roll on the “Officer” if your character is 20 or older.

| 1d6 |    Mercenary |        Guard |   Rider |     Officer |
|:---:|-------------:|-------------:|--------:|------------:|
| 1   | Construction |  Bureaucracy |    Ride |    Literacy |
| 2   |          Run |   Discipline |    Sing | Bureaucracy |
| 3   |      Tactics | Construction | Tactics |     Tactics |
| 4   |    First Aid |        Brawl |     Spy |   Diplomacy |
| 5   |        Craft |         Brew | Culture |   Behaviour |
| 6   |        Fight |        Fight |   Fight |       Fight |

> Example: Berta chooses 2× Mercenary, 2× Guard, and rolls 3 2 5 1,
> resulting in Tactics-1, Run-1, Brew-1, and Bureaucracy-1.
> And she automaticall learned Fight-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤ Strength or
Endurance (your choice) to avoid consequences. Otherwise, you
determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: The campaign was a success. For three days you
   plundered. The survivors will never forgive you for your actions.
2. Siege: Malnutrition has aged you prematurely. Roll on the aging
   table.
3. Campaign: You were ambushed and badly injured. Roll on the aging
   table.
4. Lame: After an accident, things never went back to the way they
   used to be. The Warrior career is now denied to you.
5. Captivity: The campaign was a fiasco. You have been captured. Roll
   on the aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to
   escape. If you don't succeed, another four years pass. Roll on the
   aging table again and keep trying to escape – until you succeed or
   die.
6. Lost: The campaign was a big mistake. The army was crushed. The
   fleeing were ridden down. You were never seen again.

> Example: Berta rolls 4+0 and Brunhilde does not suffer a twist of
> fate. Brunhilde is now 20 years old. The aging table does not have
> to be rolled yet.

## Mage Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Intelligence or Education (your choice).
You automatically learn Literacy-1 if you pass. If you don't, you
realize that you don't want to spend the years of your short life in
dusty libraries studying old books.

> Example: Adalric has Education-9 and Alex rolls 9. Adalric is
> accepted!

You spend four years as a Mage and learn something every year. Each
year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6.

| 1d6 | Aggressive | Passive | Manipulative | Transgressive |
|:---:|-----------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| 1   |       Fire |    Heal |        Charm |    Shapeshift |
| 2   |        Air |   Sleep |         Sing |    Necromancy |
| 3   |      Water |    Eyes |    Diplomacy | Transmutation |
| 4   |      Earth |   Doors |     Illusion |        Fusion |
| 5   |      Storm |  Plants |       People |       Animals |
| 6   |      Fight |    Brew |     Literacy |        Planes |

> Example: Alex chooses 2× Aggressive, 2× Manipulative, and rolls 5 3
> 5 2, resulting in Storm-1, Water-1, People-1, and Sing-1. And he
> automaticall learned Literacy-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤
Intelligence or Education (your choice) to avoid consequences.
Otherwise, you determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: You exposed a classmate. You will never be forgiven
   for that.
2. Failure: The experiment went wrong and the energy found a way
   through your body. Roll on the aging table.
3. Crossing borders: Research has taken you to places that cannot be
   unseen again. A demon *saw* you and will find you.
4. Trespass: You ventured too far into the space between the worlds
   and almost lost your mind. The Mage career is now denied to you.
5. Lost: You have traveled to foreign worlds and lost yourself there.
   Roll on the aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to
   find your way back. If this is not successful, another four years
   pass. Roll again on the aging table and try again – until you
   succeed or die.
6. A Sacrifice: The rift between the planes was too big, the energy
   uncontrollable, your friends were almost lost – but then you
   sacrificed yourself. Those who know the place know where to find
   you, but your screams are not for the faint of heart.

> Example: Alex rolls 4+0 and Adalric does not suffer a twist of fate.
> Adalric is now 20 years old. The aging table does not have to be
> rolled yet.

## Rapscallion Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Dexterity or Status (your choice). You
automatically learn Run-1 if you pass. If you don't, you realize
that you can't bear the endless talks, the tiresome reports, the lies
and the deceit.

> Example: Adalric changes careers (so he is now 21 years old) and
> wants to become a Rapscallion; he has Status 10 and Alex rolls 7.
> Adalric is accepted!

You spend four years as a Rapscallion and learn something every year.
Each year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6.

| 1d6 |    Thief |      Thug |        Liar |  Murderer |
|:---:|---------:|----------:|------------:|----------:|
| 1   |    Sneak |     Fight |     Culture |     Fight |
| 2   |      Spy |     Craft |   Behaviour |      Brew |
| 3   |      Run |       Run | Bureaucracy | First Aid |
| 4   |    Climb | First Aid |    Literacy |     Sneak |
| 5   | Distract |   Tactics |     Oratory | Behaviour |
| 6   |     Pick |      Sing |       Trade |    Tinker |

> Example: Alex chooses 1× Thief, 3× Murderer, and rolls 6 2 2 6,
> resulting in Pick-1, Brew-2, Tinker-1. And he automaticall
> learned Run-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤
Dexterity or Status (your choice) to avoid consequences.
Otherwise, you determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: You have humiliated your rival. He or she will never
   forgive you for that.
2. Debt: Your plan didn't work out. On the contrary, you have been
   tricked and now you owe someone more money than you can ever pay
   back.
3. Pulled in: You've accepted help from people, gotten more and more
   entangled, and now you owe them more than just a favor.
4. Caught: You were caught and pilloried. Everyone knows your face.
   The Rapscallion career is now denied to you.
5. Imprisonment: The plan has been blown. You got caught. Roll on the
   aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to escape. If
   this fails, another four years pass. Roll again on the aging table
   and try again – until you succeed or die.
6. Disappeared: There was a gang war and you disappeared. They say the
   street dogs have gotten fat this year.

> Example: Alex rolls 8+1 because he already has a career as a Mage
> behind him. Adalric suffers no twist of fate and is now 25 years
> old.

## Talents

Roll checks as follows: 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent. On very hard tests,
roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent. A +1 talent is good enough to do it for
a living. Sometimes the lack of a talent might give you a penalty of
-2 or it might disqualify you from even trying (a lack of magic
talents, for example).

The chance of rolling a target number or less on 2d6:

| 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | 11    | 12    |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 3%   | 8%   | 17%  | 28%   | 42%   | 58%   | 72%   | 83%   | 92%   | 97%   | 100%  |
| 1/36 | 3/36 | 6/36 | 10/36 | 15/36 | 21/36 | 26/36 | 30/36 | 33/36 | 35/36 | 36/36 |

## Rewards

Before you start the adventurous life, there are rewards to gain for
all these years. Roll once for each career on the appropriate table.

| 1d6 |         Warrior |            Mage |     Rapscallion |
|:---:|----------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| 1   | Intelligence +1 | Intelligence +2 | Intelligence +1 |
| 2   |    Education +2 |   Education + 1 |    Education +2 |
| 3   |       Status +1 |       Status +2 |       Status +2 |
| 4   |  Secret Society |  Secret Society |  Secret Society |
| 5   |           Horse |       Companion |             Dog |
| 6   |            Land |           Chair |            Post |

> Example: Adalric has had two careers, 1× Mage and 1× Rapscallion.
> Alex rolls 4 5, resulting in membership in a secret society and a
> dog.

**Secret Society**: The referee offers three societies to choose
from. If necessary, these are the three:

* The Ministry of the Evening Light
* The Siblings of the Dawn Treader
* The Descendants of the Frost Giants

**Companion**: An apprentice or an intelligent animal such as a cat,
an owl, or a raven. If an apprentice, name them and roll 2d6 each for
Strength, Dexterity, Endurance and Intelligence; both Education and
Status are 2.

**Dog**: A loyal companion that needs to be fed. Damage 2d6; Endurance
3d6; Life 2d6; Attack 2d6.

**Horse**: A loyal mount that requires care and feeding. Endurance
6d6; Life 3d6. When charging with a lance on horseback, you deal 3d6
damage, if your attack succeeds. Opponents on foot must use 3d6 for
their attack rolls against riders.

**Land**: A piece of land in the wilderness that has been granted to
you. Taking possession of said land is up to you however. Name your
piece of land.

**Chair**: You are welcome in your magic school and can come back at
any time to teach the young magicians something. Name your sponsor.

**Posts**: There is always a vacancy for you in your town, be it in
your gang or in the administration. Name your sponsor.

<div style="break-after: always;"></div>

## The Next Generation

If the game stretches over years in-game, this section applies.

When creating characters that are children of other characters, do not
roll for Education or Status. Instead, children inherit Education and
Status from their parents up to a maximum of 7. Orphans start with
Education-2 and Status-2.

Children are playable characters when they're 16 years old. They have
no talents and the only item of significance they own is a knife.

With every year that passes, you gain a new talent. When exactly does
a year pass? It’s up to the people playing the game. When the times
comes, pick an appropriate table to roll on. You’ll get one of the
talents on the list, but maybe not the one you were hoping for. The
year is long, after all. You can't just focus on gaining a single
talent.
{#gaining-talents}

All the other rewards you receive through play.

The world of adventure is a medieval world beyond the reaches of
empire. There are no taxes to pay, no coins to earn and nothing to
buy. Everything is a question of *gifts* and *boons*. Make friends and
perhaps they’ll give you a gift, hoping for a gift in return. Render a
service to a powerful person and hope to be granted a boon. If you
find treasure, gift it to somebody with resources. You might make a
powerful friend.

If people want you to have a weapon, they’ll give it to you: join a
militia and get a spear; go to war and get a halberd; join a court and
your lord or lady gifts you an épée; get knighted and your liege gifts
you a lance and a horse; apprentice with a hunter and get a bow.

In order to increase Status and Education, you need to increase it
in-game.

Crime rings look for gangsters and thugs, guilds look for engineers
and tradespeople, covens look for wizards and witches. Join a secret
society and increase your Education by +1.

There are always apprentices eager to learn from you. If you find one,
roll 2d6 each for Strength, Dexterity, Endurance and Intelligence;
both Education and Status are 2. They gain talents, just like you. If
they surpass you in your best talent, they leave. Having an apprentice
join you increases your Status by +1. When they leave on good terms,
your Status increases by +1 again. You can only have one apprentice at
a time.

Saving the life of a noble or winning a war with them might get you a
grant to a piece of land in the wilderness. Taking possession of said
land increases your Status by +1.

Similarly, chairs and positions are handed out in exchange for
services rendered. When a sponsor offers you a chair at a magic school
or a post with gangsters or administrators of the realm, your Status
increases by +1.

## Dice Rolls and Combat

If you want to do something and the outcome is uncertain, discuss with
the referee what to roll. Often you’ll need to roll 2d6 ≤ attribute +
talent to succeed. If it's very hard, you might have to roll 3d6 ≤
attribute + talent. If you don’t have the necessary talent, a penalty
of -2 might apply, or a roll might be impossible.

Combat is divided into rounds. Everyone may attack, cast magic, or do
something else once per round. All participants announce their action
and roll the dice. Everything happens at the same time so it is
possible for two opponents to take each other out in the same round.

When an advantage is gained through tactics, the result is often a
surprise round where the opponent cannot strike back.

If you attack successfully, you deal 2d6 damage unless you use a
halberd. This deals 3d6 damage. You can only attack as many times in a
fight as you have Endurance.

When you are hit for the first time in a fight, you must subtract the
damage from a random physical attribute. Roll 1d6: 1–2 is Strength,
3–4 is Dexterity, 5–6 is Endurance. For all other hits, you may
distribute the hit dice yourself among the three physical attributes.
You must subtract any carryover from another physical attribute.

If one of your attributes drops to 0, you are slightly injured and
pass out. After 10 minutes you wake up again.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength-10, Dexterity-6, Endurance-9. She
> gets hit for the first time and has to subtract 4+5=9 damage. Berta
> rolls a 1, so Brunhilde must subtract 9 from Strength (10-9=1). She
> won’t pass out! The second time she has to subtract 2+6=8 hits and
> chooses to subtract 2 from Dexterity (6-2=4) and 6 from Endurance
> (9-6=3). Now it’s getting close…

After the fight, all attributes recover half of the missing amount
(round down). If you are being treated by First Aid or a healer, you
are fit again in 30 minutes, otherwise the recovery takes 3 days.

> Example: After being treated with First Aid, she recovers.
> Brunhilde’s attributes: Strength 1+4½=5, Dexterity 4+1=5, Endurance
> 3+3=6.

If two of your attributes drop to 0, you are severely wounded and pass
out. You don’t wake up again for 3h and only the attributes from 0
recover to 1. With First Aid-3 or Heal-3 you can recover in an
infirmary in 5d6 days, otherwise you die.

If three of your attributes drop to 0, you die.

Expect to see half the participants down or dying after the first
round. War is terrible. Try to avoid it.

### Magic

Discuss spell effects with the referee before rolling and write down
any decisions made.

When casting spells, roll 2d6 + number of spells
cast today ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If the check fails, this
particular talent can no longer be used today.

> Example: Adalric conjures rain. He has Intelligence-9, Water-1, for
> a total of 10. Alex rolls 4+6=10 + 0 since this was the first spell
> of the day and so it rains.

### Other creatures

For all other creatures there are only Endurance and Life instead of
the known six attributes. When Endurance drops to 0, they faint; when
Life drops to 0, they die.

> Example: Adalric’s dog Tix has Endurance 3d6, Life 2d6. Alex rolls
> 1+4+5=10 and 5+2=7 and writes down 10/7 for the dog.

### Armour

Hitting opponents wearing a metal cuirass is hard: roll 3d6 ≤
attribute + talent. The reason metal cuirasses are so rare is that
they are so hard to make. They are kept in armories for times of war.
You only put them on when marching into battle. They slow you down
when plundering and when fleeing; they are cumbersome to carry around
and they give you sores. Soldiers do not like wearing them. Everything
you do is hard when you’re wearing a cuirass, except for fighting.

### Summary of the rules

Task resolution: Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If it’s
very hard, you might have to roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent. If you do
not have the talent, then there might be a -2 penalty or the task
might be impossible to attempt (such as using magical talents).

Combat: Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + weapon to hit. If you do, you deal 2d6
damage unless you use a halberd. This deals 3d6 damage. You can only
attack as many times as you have Endurance.

When you are first hit in a fight, you must subtract the damage from a
random physical attribute. Roll 1d6: 1–2 is Strength, 3–4 is
Dexterity, 5–6 is Endurance. For all other hits, you may distribute
the hit dice yourself among the three physical attributes. You must
subtract any carryover from another physical attribute (Strength,
Dexterity or Endurance).

If one of your attributes drops to 0, you are lightly wounded and pass
out. If two of your attributes drop to 0, you are mortally wounded and
you’ll die unless you are treated by somebody with First Aid-3 or
Heal-3. If three of your attributes drop to 0, you die.

## Opponents

All other chapters in this book are intended for the referee. These
chapters are for you!

People can be depicted with the well-known six attributes. You may
choose these freely (the average is 7) or roll them (2d6). Talents are
also freely determined (often 1 or 2).

Monsters and animals have different characteristics that describe
their behaviour: Count determines how many one is most likely to
encounter (the number of mounts matches the number of riders); Damage
determines how much damage they deal if they hit; Endurance determines
how many rounds they’ll fight and how much damage they can take; if it
drops to zero, they faint; excess damage is subtracted from Life; if
it drops to zero, they are mortally wounded; Fight determines whether
they fight when encountered (2d6 ≤ fight); Attack determines how well
they hit (2d6 ≤ attack), and Escape determines if they attempt to
escape when they’re not attacking (2d6 ≤ escape). If they neither
fight nor escape, they want to talk or interact in some other way.

| 1   | Nightlings | 2d6    | 2d6    | 1d6       | 1d6  | 1d6+4 | 1d6+5  | 1d6+3  |
| 2   | Predators  | 1d6    | 2d6    | 3d6       | 2d6  | 1d6+5 | 1d6+6  | 1d6+2  |
| 3   | Undead     | 1d6    | 2d6    | 3d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+6 | 1d6+7  | 1d6+0  |
| 4   | Mounts     | varies | 3d6    | 6d6       | 3d6  | 1d6+4 | 1d6+4  | 1d6+2  |
| 5   | Giants     | 1      | 4d6    | 8d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+3 | 1d6+8  | 1d6+0  |
| 6   | Dragons    | 1      | 6d6    | 10d6      | 5d6  | 1d6+2 | 1d6+9  | 1d6+0  |

Note down when you roll something and keep using those numbers. This
is how players learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the
opposition.

> Example: Claudia referees the game and needs goblins that ride on
> giant spiders that ambush the vanguard. There are 7. She uses the
> line of nightlings and mounts. Goblins: Damage-3, Endurance-1,
> Life-5, Fight-5, Attack-9, Escape-4. Giant Spiders: Damage-15,
> Endurance-16, Life-12, Fight-9, Attack-5, Escape-7. In this
> campaign, goblins are rather harmless opponents who ride on terrible
> giant spiders, which, oddly enough, are not very good at hitting
> things.

Always announce impending danger clearly, so that the players can
decide for themselves whether they want to engage in a fight.

> Example: Claudia describes how the car-sized shadows push through
> the undergrowth, how their acrid smell spreads and the animals in
> the barn panic.

If possible, the players should roll the dice, not the referee. For
example, if they want to lure the opponent into an ambush, or notice
an ambush, someone should roll against Intelligence + Tactics in both
cases.

## Magic

Just like you slowly build up a pool of enemies, you need to work out
an understanding of just how powerful magic is with the players.

> Example: How many goblins can Adalric kill with lightning? Alex and
> Claudia agree that lightning can hit a giant spider including its
> rider, doing 5d6 damage to each, or chain lightning can hit five
> goblins, doing 2d6 damage to each.

The same applies here: Make a note of what you negotiate and stick to
it!

> **Lightning**: hits an enemy and what they are carrying for 5d6 damage each  
> **Chain Lightning**: hits up to 5 enemies for 2d6 damage each

Spells can be stronger than weapon attacks but spell casting is not
limited by Endurance. Instead, the risk of exhaustion increases with
each spell cast. When casting spells, roll 2d6 + number of spells cast
today ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If the check fails, this
particular talent can no longer be used today.

> Example: Adalric casts chain lightning. It’s his second spell of the
> day so Alex has to add +1 to his roll. Adalric has Intelligence-9,
> Water-1, for a total of 10. Alex rolls 2+3=5 +1 for a total of 6 and
> the spell goes off! For damage he rolls 3+4=7 and that kills five
> goblins since they have Endurance-1 and Life-5 for a total of 6.

Magic always leads to discussions. You have to like that – otherwise
you should disallow the Mage career. How long can you breathe
underwater? Can you do magic underwater? What happens when you cast
lightning underwater? The important thing is to agree at the table and
to write down the result.

Not all magic talents are equally powerful, or equally useful. Certain
magic talents lend themselves to druids, bards, healers, necromancers,
elementalists and seers. It’s up players to find interesting uses for
their talents and it is up you as the referee to enable such
situations.

### Some notes on particular spell effects

*Summon*. There is no talent to summon demons or elementals.
Instead, use planeshifting and subjugate some demons in person.

*Charm*. Being forced into doing things you don’t want to do is
nauseating and revolting. When the magic ends, the anger starts.

*Prophecy*. It is not possible to foresee the future. A role-playing
game is not a saga; fate is not predetermined.

## Worldbuilding

The world is best built where the characters get involved. If they go
somewhere, new things are going to be discovered. When they care about
something, that thing is going to become important. Don’t ask what the
players want to see in the world, watch what their characters care
about, what the ask about, where they go, what they investigate.

The game does not offer a “reward” in the sense of gaining power.
Finding money is not worth it, there's no special equipment to buy, no
experience points to gain. That's another reason why it's important to
find out what the characters are about. A tragic end? A love story?
Owning a castle? To be knighted? Take over a gang? To travel the
world? And then you add helpers, competitors, villains, and
troublemakers to the world. This friction sharpens their profile. This
is how we see what kind of people our characters are.

### A network of people

Specifically, I recommend working up a dozen people. All have names,
attributes, a few talents, and a job. Three of them belong to a secret
society each, three belong to a temple each, three belong to a castle
each, and three belong to a magic school each. All of these
organizations have names and headquarters. People as well as
organizations want three things each and offer three rewards each. If
those wishes partly overlap and contradict each other, so much the
better.

| 1d6 | Activity  | Secret Society 1 | Secret Society 2 | Gods   | Demons   |
|:---:|-----------|------------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| 1   | Knight    | Militia          | of the pyramid   | Odin   | Set      |
| 2   | Bard      | Scribes          | of the moon      | Freya  | Orcus    |
| 3   | Thief     | Pentarchs        | of the circle    | Thor   | Pazuzu   |
| 4   | Mage      | Students         | of history       | Mitra  | Nergal   |
| 5   | Librarian | Servants         | of consciousness | Marduk | Hel      |
| 6   | Merchant  | Cooperation      | of order         | Ishtar | Zathogga |

### Names for settlements

The first few names of villages, castles and witch towers can be
generated with the following tables. Pick a column for the beginning
of a name and a column for the end of a name. Take a look at local
maps for inspiration.

| 1d6 | Castle 1 | Castle 2 | Castle 3 | Village | Magic 1 | Magic 2 | Magic 3 |
|:---:|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1   | Watch-   | Falcon-  | -fort    | -thorp  | Witch-  | Flame-  | -tower  |
| 2   | Olden-   | Fern-    | -hill    | -dale   | Raven-  | Death-  | -watch  |
| 3   | Bear-    | Glad-    | -rock    | -wick   | Devil-  | Temple- | -crest  |
| 4   | New-     | Blade-   | -stone   | -ley    | Fell-   | High-   | -wood   |
| 5   | Good-    | Ram-     | -ward    | -ton    | Dark-   | Sky-    | -hole   |
| 6   | Star-    | Frost-   | -hall    | -ford   | Ice-    | Cat-    | -stead  |

### Names for people

For people's names, I like to look up a baby name list online and use
that for my world. Here are a few tables for names with a Franconian
touch. You can add -o, -a or -e at the end, or reverse the two
elements, e.g. Chlodobert, Theudebald, Hildebart, Gertrud).

| 1d6 | Name 1 | Name 2  | Name 3 | Name 4 | Name 5 | Name 6 |
|:---:|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1   | Adal-  | Chlodo- | -ger   | -burg  | Ada    | Chloe  |
| 2   | Amal-  | Charde- | -man   | -gard  | Berta  | Gregor |
| 3   | Bald-  | Gunde-  | -mund  | -gund  | Gyso   | Frieda |
| 4   | Bert-  | Os-     | -ric   | -hild  | Dodo   | Siggo  |
| 5   | Brun-  | Sigi-   | -hard  | -lind  | Hilde  | Ardo   |
| 6   | Ger-   | Theude- | -sind  | -trud  | Inge   | Gisela |

### Names for monsters

Intelligent monsters and mountains should also have names. For giants
and dragons, I like to use names that indicate forces of nature.

| 1d6 | Name 1 | Dragons  | Giants  | Mountain 1 | Mountain 2 |
|:---:|--------|----------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1   | Ice    | -pharynx | -hammer | Needle     | -mount     |
| 2   | Frost  | -breath  | -smith  | Hell       | -horn      |
| 3   | Fire   | -spout   | -maker  | Division   | -crag      |
| 4   | Poison | -needle  | -father | Dark       | -height    |
| 5   | Plague | -puff    | -mother | Red        | -ridge     |
| 6   | Shadow | -smoke   | -tooth  | Frozen     | -peak      |

### Names for treasures

Treasures that these people, giants, and dragons may have and that
they might want to steal from each other. For this you should make up
two or three important people from the past: prophets, heroines, and
so on, as well as the name of a dark lord and his realm. Names matter!

| 1d6 | What    | What for         | Who invented it?                 |
|:---:|---------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1   | Ring    | of Invisibility  | The Ruler of the Night           |
| 2   | Sword   | of Invincibility | The Lady of the Lake             |
| 3   | Crown   | of Power         | The First Judge                  |
| 4   | Spear   | of Destruction   | from the Last Days of the Empire |
| 5   | Book    | of the Saint     | (a well-known person)            |
| 6   | Chalice | of Redemption    | (a god, goddess, or demon)       |

## Talents for the opposition

These are the same talents used for character creation, all on one
page so that it's easy to pick some for the opposition.
{#opposition}

Remember that “Fight” means you choose a weapon instead: knife,
spear, halberd, épée, bow, lance.

## Campaigns

A campaign is the long game. Maintaining interest over multiple years
time can be tricky. In addition to that, you can’t prepare the whole
game before it starts. This section helps you run the long game.

The following elements all generate and maintain long term interest:

* The changes player actions effect on the game world
* The changing game play for players as their characters grow in power
* The changed understanding of the world as time progresses

The long game promises ever changing game-play. Here are some
suggested changes you can first foreshadow and then institute:

*Interventions*. People ask for help and when player characters help
out, the situation changes for the better – visibly, permanently.

An example would be a village that suffer from raids by spider
goblins. As the party arrives, the villagers beg the party to rid the
village of the goblins. If the party succeeds, the villagers will
remember. Whenever the party passes through, there is a feast and the
villagers sing their song.

To foreshadow this, make a list of a handful of interventions that
non-player characters have made, such as: “Thidrek slew the giant Grim
with the sword Nagelring which the dwarf Alberich had made for
Thidrek.” It adds two non-player characters that can be met, it
introduces an important item that can be gained, it establishes a bit
of history of the setting – this one sentence pulls a lot of weight.

![A small town with castle and church by a lake](images/Urs_Graf_Stadt_am_Seeufer_(1514).jpg)
A town by the lake shore (1514), by Urs Graf
{: .pic .small }

*Reputation.* Non-player characters have a reputation for at least
one thing they did in the past, big or small. The sentence above
with Thidrek slaying the giant is a non-player character having a
reputation. It foreshadows that reputation can be gained.

As soon as the player characters have done something similar, have
people react to the reputation this engenders. Give players epithets
like “dragon slayers” or have people remember how they stole
Alberich’s cloak of invisibility. This is the reputation they gain.

*Reactions*. The reputation gained has an effect on the world. When
the player characters are young, the beggar king of Signisport
harasses them. When the player characters are older, the beggars of
Signisport report to them and try to win their favour.

Don’t hold back with positive reactions. This is not a valley of
tears. The adventure game is entertaining because it allows us to
overcome adversity. We are powerless enough in the real world. Let’s
not put that into our games for the sake of “realism”.

*Power levels*. Every increase in talent unlocks new powers. You need
to decide what the range of power levels is going to look like. A good
range would be from 1 to 5. An Education-11 Fire-5 Pyromancer is able
to pass a difficult check with 3d6 ≤ 16 with 98% chance of success.
Thus the entire span of talents fits into the range from 1 to 5: First
Aid-1 is good enough to do the job of a field medic, but only a First
Aid-3 or Heal-3 will save a man doomed to die. Similarly, a
sorceress with Fire-5 knows the secrets of Muspelheim and has spoken
with Sutr, the lord of fire.

![Men with polearms gather beneath a flag](images/Urs_Graf_Versammlung_von_Reisläufern,_(1515).jpg)
Mercenaries gathering (1515), by Urs Graf
{: .pic .left }

*World changing events*. If the players aren’t changing the setting,
it changes of its own accord. This is why you shouldn’t invest too
much in the present state of affairs. Instead of thinking about the 28
cousins of the duke, invest some time in 4 cousins of the duke and be
ready to overthrow the duke and his family.

To foreshadow this, make sure that you occasionally mention how things
used to be different. Remember how quickly times change. Here are
Celts, they want to move but Caesar conquers Gaul instead. Not long
after that, the Romans leave, the Goths come. Then the Franks. Then
the Vikings. The Normans. All of that in the span of a few hundred
years. Have a list of two or three previous periods to refer to. The
invasion of the Huns. The reign of the Völsung.

*The present*. Make sure big changes are not a thing of the distant
past. The era when giants ruled the earth is interesting lore and
explains the existence of giant castles, but it doesn’t mean much
unless they’re coming back in the next handful of sessions. Then
again, if they are – more power to you!

To foreshadow this, have visible agents of future change show up.
There are rebels in the imperial capital – the rebellion is brewing
right here, right now. There are reports of war bands signalling
coming invasion. There are refugees from the recent floods and the
oracles say it’s going to get worse come rainy season. These people
show up in the next session. Change is afoot!

*Understanding*. Some players feel happy when they find an explanation
for how things work, why things are the way they are. Perhaps humans
have a tendency towards searching for causes. In order to satisfy this
curiosity, create (very short) histories for places and cultures that
can be discovered through play. Don’t have players learn about these
through books or sages. Have them discover these secrets.

To foreshadow this, knowledgeable non-player characters are always
eager to learn more, willingly part with information they have and are
always happy to get updates from player characters. Don’t lock
knowledge away. Don’t make sages tight-lipped and cagey. Instead, let
them be librarians, always eager to add new books to the library (and
place books liberally in your setting). In exchange for books found,
librarians divulge more secrets, and place new burial mounds, new
ruined castles and new entrances to the underworld onto the players’
map. This is easily combined with “interventions” above: The sages and
librarians ask the players to follow up on cues and are grateful when
they do. Another virtuous cycle ensues.

An example for such a chain of secrets would be this: The power of the
king is due to the riches he amassed → he got these riches from a
dragon’s hoard → he got this hoard with an invisibility cape → he got
this cape from a dwarf king → this dwarf king still lives in Niflheim
and has cursed the gold. These chains don’t have to be too long. Five
steps is a good start. Make sure to have several such chains for
players to learn about.

Here’s another example: The king’s wife used to be a ferocious fighter
→ she had promised to marry only the one would best her in a wrestling
match → the king didn’t stand a chance and had implored his best
friend to help him – using the invisibility cape → this best friend
then got to marry the most beautiful woman in the land.

Each link in the chain is a secret to be uncovered, each can be an
aside learned in an adventure. The adventure is never just about
learning such a secret. The secret is icing on the cake.

This game doesn’t have long lists of monsters to fight, or magic items
to win, or spells to learn. Those imply a kind of changing game-play
over time. That’s why you need to focus on all the other aspects
touched upon in this section.

## Running the game

Questions can inspire us to think about issues and they make it clear
that our input is required. Reading a setting or an adventure book is
less useful because it takes a long time and when you’re in trouble,
your instinct will be to turn back to the book you’ve been reading.
This slows you down and you’ll feel inadequate. Don’t do it. Questions
let you know that whatever you come up with is OK.

There are different kinds of questions that are important to the game.
Think of them as table techniques.

### A question of style

A simple question to ask is how things are accomplished or how they
fail. Players announce what they want their characters to achieve, you
clarify the intent and indicate what a successful outcome would
entail, you warn them about consequences of failure, you suggest the
attribute and the talent and whether to roll two or three dice. If the
players accept, they pick up the dice and roll.

Once you know about success or failure, and having established the
consequences, you can move on – or you can linger for a bit. Give that
character a little spotlight and ask about how they did it, why they
did it, how they felt as they did it. Why did that speech fail, was it
something they did? Perhaps the player doesn’t have an answer. No
problem, you already agreed on the consequences. But maybe the player
feels like embellishing it or putting their own spin on it. This is
the moment! You ask them a question and they get to tell us about
their character. It’s an entertaining moment of character exposition
at the table.

### A question about the past

In-game knowledge is not covered by the rules. There is no history or
geography talent, for example. And yet, characters probably do know
something. So if the characters are about to enter Hunland, they might
ask you about the inhabitants. You can turn that around and ask the
players whether any of their players had previous experience with a
guest from Hunland or whether their parents had ever taken them there.

These questions are about player characters and their backgrounds. If
the player likes to improvise these details, they get to entertain
everybody at the table and to enrich the game and everybody gets a
glimpse into the past of a fellow character. It’s a short moment of
spotlight within the context of the game. The answer given by the
player colours the answer you’re going to give about the inhabitants
of Hunland. The questions build on each other. It’s a virtuous cycle.

### A question of character

Cultivate a sense of wonder about the player characters. What are they
doing, what are they thinking, what are they feeling? Don’t ask these
questions at the table but keep them in mind when daydreaming. These
questions are asked and answered through play. If Isolt and a player
character are on a ship, start wondering about the player character.
Are they faithful to their partner? Are they loyal to their king? Let
Isolt fall in love with the character and you’re all going to find
out!

The situation develops into a question directed at players. Does the
character elope with Isolt and prove to be a lover, not a fighter?
Let’s see. Actions count more than words, both in the game and out of
the game.

Questions for players work on two levels. The first level is: What do
you do? The bandits are asking for the tribute they demanded last
year. Are you helping to defend the village or are you leaving? The
second level is: How hard is your soul? The headman begs you to stay.
The miller asks you to protect the mill that’s outside the perimeter.
The farmer hides his daughter from you. All these questions pop up as
you daydream about the bandits, the village, the player characters,
and you wonder: What are they doing, what are they thinking, what are
they feeling?

### Questions for referees

Players can ask you questions: Are there any consequence for killing
the baron? Can we get rid of Rasputin?

Sometimes players will let you know what they have in mind. Sometimes
you’ll have to ask them. Sometimes they don’t know. If player’s don’t
know what they want, then that’s OK. Present them with more choices.
It’s your turn to ask them questions. See the next sections.

If you know what the players are wondering, set up situations that
allow us all to find out. Are there consequences for killing the
baron, of getting rid of Rasputin? Of course there are! How are the
players going to find out? An assassination needs to be planned.
Allies need to be found. Plans for a succession need to be made.
Friends need to be in place. Moles have to be planted.

As players ask the question, you start to dream. Perhaps you remember
reading about the assassination of Rasputin? Look it up, think about
the parts you find fascinating. The tables turn and now you get to ask
questions. How are the going to find allies? Once they do find allies,
use the ally to tell players more. The ally is worried about the power
vacuum. Who’s going to succeed the baron? Who’s going to talk to the
guards? The players wanted to know, and you’re giving it to them in a
way that leads to more questions. It’s more of that virtuous cycle.

### Guiding questions

As you daydream about the setting, imagining landscapes and people and
problems, the questions can be a guide into an unfamiliar dreamland.
The questions get you into the mood for a game that’s unfamiliar to
you.

Why are the dwarves undermining the castle? The question already
implies that no giant moles or purple worms are going to be involved.
You start thinking of the dwarves. Are these the strong dwarves
wielding axes or are these sly and skinny dwarves? The first question
leads to more questions, guides you imagination. Your input is
required.

You often need to make up stuff. You read your notes and remember your
ideas and then you fill in the gaps at the table. You present a world
to the players that is apparently seamless and ongoing, forever
conjuring up new material. Wherever player characters go, there’s more
to see and more to discover. Sometimes, you didn’t prepare for this.
In these moments, you fall back to what is familiar. Falling back to
familiar ideas is something all referees do.

Between sessions, however, you prepare for the game. The conjuration
at the table are not arbitrary. Sessions are short and between
sessions, you prepare again. This is why guiding questions are
important. They help you prepare the unfamiliar. You’ll fall back to
the familiar at the table, when you’re stressed, and that’s OK.

### Taking questions off the list

Review the questions after a few sessions, note which of them have
been answered and move on. There’s no point in dwelling on them.
Replace the questions that have been answered and the questions you no
longer care for with new questions.

## Adventures

Where do ideas for adventures come from?

*Player needs come first*. The character needs are only of interest in
so far as consistency increases our willingness to believe in the
fantasy world and therefore it entertains us. If the actions of
characters hurt a player, then it’s time for them to go. Let the
player make a new character who’s a better fit. If the adventure bores
the table, then it’s time to change track. Move the characters into a
different situation.

*Mutual entertainment*. This means that players must care for the
other players at the table. Lift each other up. Engage with each other
and the situation. If one character is a morose pyromaniac or a secret
devil worshipper, try to be a good friend to them and see where that
tension takes you. If one character is a lighthearted religious
fighter, try to be a serious religious fanatic, a serious atheist. If
one characters is a fighting machine, call upon them to solve problems
with violence, treat them like a thug. Or try to educate them and lift
them up. The point is to pick something in your friends’ characters
that you can engage with, and do it. Don’t make their lives miserable
– look for just the right level of banter. Show your interested in
their character. Look for something to say to each other during the
game.

*Player agency*. In a game that takes place in your imagination, the
greatest asset we have is the freedom of it all. We can make decisions
and the imaginary world reacts. We can try things we don’t usually do, be
the people we don’t usually are. This is why decision making is
essential. Skip the long monologues, the long descriptions, the long
transitions – move quickly until the game needs players to make a
decision. “What do you do?” These can be big decisions or small
decisions. Do you join the court of Etzel? Do you fight the dragon? Do
you support the dwarves? Do you taunt the mermaids? Are you courteous
to the librarian? Do you flirt with the mercenary? Don’t invalidate
choice by asking for a decision that has no weight.

*Risk taking*. Making a decision is exciting when there’s something at
risk. It’s like betting. A character stays in the fight because the
player is betting on them winning that last exchange. A character
flirts with the mercenary betting to win them over without a fight.
Emphasise the danger and highlight the reward until it’s a hard
decision to make. The risks must always be worth it. Some players like
to play it safer than others. Encourage them with non-player
characters, help them control the risk, don’t push them too hard. Aim
for those butterflies.

*Community building*. When villagers are grateful, when prisoners are
rescued, when the downtrodden are lifted up, there’s your opportunity
to get into community building. This is an example of goals players
can set themselves. Encourage this by having non-player characters
suggest it. Have the grateful ruler present a character with a land
grant. Once community building begins, the community members have
needs that must be met. Use these as inspiration for future
adventures.

*Buildings*. Buildings can house your community or they can act as
signs of power and influence. Build a castle to house retainers. Build
a ditch, a palisade or a wall to protect the village. Build a
fortified bridge to defend against pirates raiding inland on their
ships. Have non-player characters suggest and organise it so that you
can take their needs into account when thinking about future
adventures.

Usually nobody at the table knows what exactly is required for
buildings. Assume that everything is handled by the builder with a few
exceptions. It’s these exceptions that turn into adventures: These are
building blocks that the builder could not organise. Organising them
involves an adventure.

*Family*. Encourage characters to raise a family. You can look at it
as a particular way of building community, but it also plays into our
expectations. Let players play the relatives and children of their
deceased character. This encourages other players to raise a family.
Finding a partner and rising in status to find a good match provides
more ideas for adventures.

*Status*. Each Status score qualifies a character for certain events
that raise their status even further. In marriage proposals and in the
choice of boons granted by superiors, the current status of a
character is essential. Families do not consent to a child’s marriage
below their station. Lord and ladies don’t grant land to orphans.
{ #status-increase }

The following table reflects a society of nobles and warriors where an
intellectual is always inferior to a warrior and a warrior is always
inferior to a noble. The last column provides ideas for future
adventures. By succeeding in an appropriate adventure, player
characters get the option of increasing their Status by 1 that year,
in addition to [rolling for a talent increase](#gaining-talents).

| Status | Examples                 | Qualifies for…                    |
|:------:|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2      | orphan, beggar           | a job                             |
| 3      | worker, peasant, artisan | confidence, secret plans          |
| 4      | citizen of good standing | secret society membership         |
| 5      | member of society        | public office, public works       |
| 6      | officer                  | a position to teach               |
| 7      | magister                 | a position as an advisor at court |
| 8      | warrior                  | being knighted, a land grant      |
| 9      | knight, lady             | building a castle                 |
| 10     | baron, baroness          | leading an army                   |
| 11     | duke, duchess            | being crowned, winning a war      |
| 12     | royalty                  | empire, conquest                  |
| 13     | emperor, empress         | eternal life and undeath          |

*Education*. By succeeding in an appropriate adventure, player
characters get the option of increasing their Education by 1 that
year, in addition to [rolling for a talent increase](#gaining-talents).
What are appropriate adventures? Diplomatic missions, expeditions to
foreign lands, time spent in other realms, library adventures.
{ #education-increase }

*Growing old*. People work the fields in spring, go on adventure in
summer, bring in the harvest in autumn, cut wood, raise a barn, study.
They grow old. When characters or their companions are 36 years old,
and every four years after that, they need to check for physical
decline. If an attribute falls to zero, the character dies.

| 1d6 |     Aging Table |
|:---:|----------------:|
| 1   |     Strength -1 |
| 2   |    Dexterity -1 |
| 3   |    Endurance -1 |
| 4   | Intelligence -1 |
| 5   |          Lucky! |
| 6   |          Lucky! |

After a certain number of years, the health of animals starts to
decline as well. Horses start to lose 1 Life per year after 20 years
of service. Dogs start to lose 1 Life per year after 10 years of
service.

*Death*. When a character dies, their land, buildings, animals, and
weapons are divided fairly between surviving partners and children.

*Children*. Raising a child as your own allows it to inherit Education
and Status up to 7 when it reaches 16 years of age. Children raised by
more than one parent get to chose which Education and Status they
inherit.

This game doesn’t care about the dangers of child birth, of disease,
the difficulty of raising a family, the sanctity of marriage, the sex
lives of characters. Run the game you want and let players experiment
with leading different lives.

## Fragments of Play

This section offers examples from an imaginary game illustrating all
the ideas. The three people involved Alex, Berta and Claudia. Alex
plays Adalric and Berta plays Brunhilde; Claudia is the referee.

### Preparation for the first game

Before meeting for the first time, Claudia already knows that the two
characters have Status-2 because it’s the start of the campaign. These
two kids did not inherit Education or Status. Looking at the
[Status](#status-increase) table, this means they’ll need a job. The
[Education](#education-increase) section mentions library adventures.
Should either of the two plan on playing a mage, increasing Education
is going to be on their mind.

Visiting somebody in a library and getting a book is the adventure.
Questions: Who needs the book? Who opposes this? Other urchins that
didn’t get the job: Urs the bully, with Status-3 (also an orphan but
with slightly better Status) and Discipline-1 (which I just assigned).
He’s not much of a boss, but there’s also Strength-8 (above average)
and Brawl-1 (also assigned). If Discipline and Brawl are his
only talents, he’s 18 years old, two years older than the new
characters Alex and Berta are going to make.

Question for later: Does Urs have friends? Does he have enemies? Play
to find out! He probably has a lackey, and there’s probably a love
interest as well, right?

The library belongs to a wizard. Claudia needs a name and picks
“Ulrike the Beautiful”. The starting village also needs a name. Maybe
the village has always belonged to Ulrike’s family and the rulers all
have names that sound similar: Ulrich, Ulberth, Ulberga. Ulrichen!

This makes her wonder about Urs the bully. The name sounds similar to
Ulrike. Are they related? A question to save for later.

Claudia needs some more adventure ideas. How about adding a secret
society? “The Brothers and Sisters of Horned Mask” – a society that
wears masks at their meetings. They all know each other in real life
but within their society, they also represent the animal or demon of
their mask. So miss Trudeberg, the head of a large family farm, wears
the wooden mask of a devil with deer horns and red pearls hanging from
its ears. It’s the local “Cherry Devil”, known to tempt the young with
poisonous fruit. And indeed, she is a talented brewer of potions and
poisons. Maybe she needs the book. Why doesn’t she fetch it herself?

Trudeberg is looking for a particular fruit, the “Black Eye Grape”. It
grows in the ruin of Hawk Rock, rumoured to be home to a “wild man”,
a forest creature that doesn’t speak and hates all humans.

All of these ideas show that random tables for quick name generation
are necessary because names are important. They allow everybody at the
table to write down a name and add more information. This is how the
imaginary world gets fixed in our imagination.

### Starting the first session

Claudia says, “Alright, Adalric and Brunhilde live in Ulrichen.
Anything we need to know about them? Parents? Siblings?”

Alex says, “Adalric is a slightly above average guy. Pretty smart.
He’d like to be a mage one day. He has a cloak and that’s more than
many kids his age have.”

Berta says, “Brunhilde is not very smart by pretty strong. I’m sure
she’ll be a good fighter one day. She has long brown hair in a thick
braid.”

Claudia says, “Right. Ulrichen has the tower of Ulrike the Beautiful,
a recluse and a wizard. You’ve both been called by lady Trudeberg, a
powerful head of a large farm, mother of many and grandmother of
countless children. She looks at you and says: ‘Adalric, I need you to
go up to the tower and ask lady Ulrike for a book called The Grapes of
Eelgau. Brunhilde will look after you.’ She waits. Do you agree?”

Alex says, “Sure, I want to meet the wizard!”

Berta says, “Brunhilde grumbles, why am I being commanded to be his
bodyguard?”

Claudia says, “You’re asking Trudeberg, yeah? She says she is sending
you because she knows you’re not afraid of anything and if you she’ll
have her daughter Gerfled teach you about stick fighting.”

Berta nods. “Let’s go.”

As you can see, Claudia improvised as she was talking. Berta seemed to
expect some sort of reward and Claudia hadn’t prepared anything so she
looked at the list of names and picked a name for the stick fighting
daughter without missing a beat. At the end of the year, the players
get to pick one talent to increase. There is no stick-fighting talent
so this is an invitation to have Brunhilde learn Brawl-1, if Berta
wants to.

Note how neither of the players asked why protection was needed or why
the book was required. That’s fine. No exposition is necessary if
nobody is asking.

At the beginning we see how neither Alex nor Berta are into describing
their characters. A detail like a piece of clothing or a detail about
their looks is all it takes. Both looked at [their stats](#stats) and
improvised a little description. That’s all that’s required.

Claudia says, “As you walk through the village, you see some kids
driving pigs along the way. One of them is Urs. He sees you two with
your clean clothes and smirks. Then he drives the pigs your way.”

Alex says: “Ugh.”

Berta says, “Are you looking for a fight, Urs? I’ll give you a fight
if you want to.”

### Asking for rolls

Claudia says, “It’s a question of self-discipline to face a dozen pigs
on a muddy road without making a fool of yourself. How about a roll of
Intelligence + Discipline?”

Berta says, “Maybe. But courage in the face of a dozen pigs doesn’t
seem like something that depends on brains. How about brawns? Strength
gives confidence!”

Claudia says, “Allright, Strength + Discipline it is. If you fail, you
have to fall back. There’s no -2 penalty because I don’t think this
requires military discipline and experience. This is just a question
of courage.”

Berta rolls 2d6 and gets an 8 which is ≤ 10, Brunhilde’s Strength.
“Come here, Urs! Come and face me! Brunhilde pushes through the pig
herd.”

Alex rolls 2d6 and also gets an 8 which is ≤ 8, Adalric’s Strength.
“Yeah, Urs! You can’t hide behind the pigs. I see you!”

Claudia says, “I think he’s going to try and punch Adalric.”

Berta says, “And I’m going to punch him!”

Claudia rolls 2d6 and gets 5 which is ≤ 8 + 1; Berta rolls 2d6 and
gets 8 again, which is ≤ 10 - 2 (no Brawl!) – both Urs and
Brunhilde hit!

Claudia says, “As you beat Urs with a higher result, you have no
problem getting to him. You punch him just as he shoved Adalric into
the mud. I don’t think there’s going to be much of fight here, right?
They all just part ways?”

Berta says, “Yeah. I tell him: Don’t you ever touch my friend again,
you understand?”

Claudia says, “He’s holding his jaw and follows his pigs. This might
not have been the last of him.”

Claudia improvised the pigs. All she knew is that Urs was going to
show up and establish that he was not friendly, giving Brunhilde a
chance to show what kind of bodyguard she was. Apparently she’s loyal
and quick to strike. Adalric, on the other hand, appears to be meek
and willing to let her do the talking and posturing. We learned
something about player and non-player characters!

The part where Berta suggests a different attribute to use for the
roll is par for the course. The whole table gets to decide how things
are going to be resolved. It’s the referee’s responsibility to figure
out how to the world reacts to the player characters, but it is not
the case that the referee is the only one to decide what rules to
apply.

The fact that when both sides roll a success the one who rolls higher
is somehow more successful than the other is something Claudia decided
on the spot, based on her experience with another game she played a
few years ago.

### A powerful non-player character

Claudia says, “Adalric and Brunhilde are climbing the winding trail
that leads up to the tower of Ulrike the Beautiful. It’s a hot day in
spring and the crickets are loud. A crow seems to be watching you,
always retreating uphill as you approach.”

Silence. Alex and Berta don’t know what to do with the crow info.

Claudia jumps forward in time, “You arrive at the tower. It stands
right at the precipice overlooking the Ulrichen valley. You see that a
gap of a few meters separates Ulrike’s tower from the rest of the
mountain. It stands on a stone column of its own.”

Berta says, “It’s well defended. Do we see the witch?”

Claudia says, “As you look around, you see the face of a woman
appearing in a narrow window above the gate that opens into the void
separating the tower from you. ‘What do you want, kids?’”

Alex says, “I’ve come to fetch the Grapes of Eelgau for lady
Trudeberg!”

Claudia says, “I see… she wiggles her head and mumbles a few words.
The stone on both sides of the gap stretches, as if there were giant
hands beneath the surface trying to touch each other. You can walk
over these stone fingers to the door. It opens and there she is,
Ulrike the Beautiful.”

Alex says, “All right! I explain about the book. Lady Trudeberg needs
it. We’re just here to fetch the book. Or is she going to teach me a
spell?”

Claudia says, “She’ll let you take a look at her books for a day if
you’ll go up the mountain and pick some Blue Roaring Ears at the Lake
of Tears. Just be nice to the marmot man who lives by the lake. You
get the feeling that this could be the start of a working
relationship. Maybe also not the last errand you’ll run for her if you
agree.”

Alex looks at Berta and she shrugs. He says, “OK, we’ll do it.”

When the players handled Urs, Claudia realised she hadn’t prepared
much for Ulrike. What sort magic did she have? No time to roll dice.
That would have to come later. So a quick look at the
[list](#opposition) and she jotted down Heal, Sleep, Doors,
Plants, Brew, Charm, Diplomacy, Illusion, Literacy – classic
Passive and Manipulative careers.

After the game, Claudia picks Ulrike’s age, say 50. So we have a long
career of 34 years after the age of 16 and therefore 34 dice to roll.
Let’s take 4d6 and roll four times on the Passive table, four times on
the Manipulative table, and add each of the talents we listed above
at 1. Using 2d6 for attributes, this is Ulrike the Beautiful:
Strength-8 Dexterity-8 Endurance-12 Intelligence-6 Education-8
Status-3 Heal-2 Sleep-6 Eyes-4 Doors-2 Plants-5 Brew-2 Charm-5 Sing-4
Diplomacy-4 Illusion-3 People-3 Literacy-4. Surprisingly fit! She
probably does a lot of hiking up here in the mountains. And fantastic
Sleep, Plants and Charm talents!

### Encounters

The players are heading up into the mountains. Why is the lake called
the Lake of Tears?

Claudia says, “The way up is hard going. It’s steep and the wind is
cold. You’ve been hearing the marmots whistling and you’ve been seeing
the bearded vultures circling. How about you give me an Endurance roll
to see how well you’re holding up.”

Alex says, “What happens when we fail?”

Claudia says, “How about you need to spend the night because you’re
exhausted?”

Alex rolls 10 which is higher than 7. Berta rolls a 12 which is higher
than 9. Neither has the Climb talent. Berta says, “It’s going to be a
long night.”

When Claudia had mentioned the marmot man, she didn’t have anything
particular in mind. Some kind of fay creatures – and so she rolls for
a [Nightling](#opponents): Damage-10 Endurance-6 Life-4 Fight-9
Attack-6 Escape-7. It’s aggressive and deals a lot of damage! Maybe he
wields a devil blade? Or is it some sort of desiccation magic that he
wields via the twigs of a sacred tree? She goes with that.

Now, questions: Is the marmot man evil? Why is he opposed to humans
gathering Blue Roaring Ears? How might he be convinced to part with
them? Why does he live up there? She jots down some ideas for later:
devil, giant, ice magic. How does he react?

{: .pic .right }

| 2d6 | Reaction                              |
|:---:|---------------------------------------|
| 2   | attempt to kidnap and ransom you      |
| 3   | rob you, take your stuff              |
| 4   | threaten you and your friends         |
| 5   | demand help and cooperation           |
| 6   | refuse to cooperate                   |
| 7   | be sceptical, doubt your competence   |
| 8   | be wavering, doubt your success       |
| 9   | only take safe bets, stay in the back |
| 10  | cooperate, take reasonable orders     |
| 11  | be friendly, offer sympathy           |
| 12  | be helpful, offer advice              |

Don’t feel that the answers to all these questions should have been
prepared ahead of time. The players go in unexpected directions and
the world needs to expand, seamlessly. Wherever players look, more
stuff gets added. What we need to do is prepare the bones. Assembly
happens at the table.

### Between sessions

Adalric and Brunhilde spent then night up in the mountains, managed to
run from the wolves, met the marmot man and were courteous and he let
them gather some Blue Roaring Ears if they brought back Little Man
Moss to Ulrike and made sure she taught it all she knew about botany
for a year and a day. They agreed to that and went back, convinced
Ulrike to take the little green creature, got the book, brought it to
Lady Trudeberg, and Adalric was invited to read some books along with
Little Man Moss and Brunhilde was invited to come train with Lady
Trudeberg’s daughter Waltrud.

Time to level up! What did they learn? Adalric spent time doing
Passive magic, so he rolls a d6 and gets a 4: Doors! Is he sneaking
around in Ulrike’s tower, going through her stuff? Claudia decides to
add some hidden secrets for Adalric to find, if he wants to risk it.

And what about Brunhilde? It was physical, being Adalric’s bodyguard,
and surviving in the wilderness. She rolls a d6 and gets a 3:
Construction! Building shelters, helping out on the farm, it made her
better at building things.

Time for players to go home or log off, and Claudia is daydreaming
about the game, thinking about the non-player characters and taking
notes. Are Ulrike and the Marmot Man friends or foes? Maybe a
competitive relationship? Power over the plants and mushrooms? Is
there a passage to Myrkheim and the Ur-forest of the mushroom king?
Which side would the players pick? If they meet again, Marmot Man is
going to send them on a mission to Myrkheim. Ulrike is going to tell
them how to steal the secret of sleeping spores from the mushroom king
and the players will have to decide where their loyalties lie.

And what about Ulrike? With Sleep-6 she must have been to the
dreamlands, maybe she had a long love affair with Orpheus himself
which ended in opium-fueled nightmare battles and charms and counter
charms. And finally she left, retired to this place, started weaving a
net of plants and charms. What would be the little secrets to discover
along the way? No-go zones around the house → dream hounds → trails to
the shadow lands → Orpheus’ ring.

The ring is also a great treasure that somebody might want to steal –
a new secret society, perhaps? The Great Association Joy and
Happiness, agents of free love, no rulers, drunken revelry and fairy.
The ring grants them a favour by Lady Butterflies, ruler of Change and
Transformation.

Another thing to find: books of nightmares and curses, dreamland
violence. Those books might be there for Adalric to discover, to ask
Ulrike about them, to see her mien freeze and hear her speak in the
fell voice of Cold Charm…

Claudia is throwing out words without knowing what they mean, but
it’ll be easy to add more words later, once she knows that the players
are in fact going to be interested. She just wants to stay one or two
steps ahead. If more stuff gets added wherever players look, that also
means that stuff remains open and vague as long as nobody is looking.
For now, she needs more seeds of conflicting loyalties, of love
interests, of envy and jealousy…

### The plans of non-player characters

Lady Trudeberg and The Brothers and Sisters of Horned Mask, what about
them? Claudia reviews her notes and sees the grape was supposed to
grow in the ruin of Hawk Rock, which didn’t make an appearance and
that the “forest creature” there hates all humans. Since Claudia had
forgotten about it, Hawk Rock must be a ruin somewhere else and the
forest creatures is probably a bugbear. She prepares bugbears and
rolls on the [Nightling](#opponents) table again: Damage-5 Endurance-3
Life-5 Fight-9 Attack-9 Escape-9. Quick to attack, quick to run,
squishy, that’s the local bugbears.

What about Urs and his love interest? Claudia doesn’t want to add
domestic violence to the game, so perhaps the girl is Krimlind,
daughter of Krimhild, and there should be a scene where The Brothers
and Sisters of Horned Mask meet and some potion is shared, and
Krimlind is there and looking at Adalric and Brunhilde across the room.
Let’s see if either of them reacts.

Claudia wants to show how the world changed due to things the players
did: reputation gained. Here’s a boon for them: Little Man Moss comes
by and thanks them before the year is up. He gives them the magic word
that allows Adalric or Brunhilde to contact it three times when spoken
to a patch of moss.

Claudia also wants to foreshadow events to come. These events should
be unrelated to the dreamlands and to magic users. Something for
fighters or rapscallions. Lord Obersaxo is recruiting mercenaries to
fight in the war of city states to the south. Perhaps such a campaign
might end up being the actual campaign, if players let themselves get
drawn into it. Perhaps the actual campaign is about overthrowing Lord
Obersaxo. Before doing anything, however, his plans needs to be
introduced. Witegund is his delegate, come here to recruit. Urs is one
of the first to be recruited. When next Adalric and Brunhilde meet,
Urs is armed with a spear and he has armed friends at his side. Now
what?

![Eight warriors and a rider](images/Urs_Graf_Acht_Krieger_und_ein_Reiter_in Landschaft_(1507).jpg)

{: .pic .small }

### Long term goals

After a two or three sessions, Adalric and Brunhilde have defeated
some nightlings, they have made new friends, they have been of service
to people of power, what now? Time to find out what their long term
goals are. Claudia could ask the two players, Alex and Berta, but
sometimes people don’t actually know what they want when asked
directly. It is therefore often better to offer options within the
game and see how players react.

Do they want to improve the infrastructure? A non-player character
sighs and complains about there being no alchemist. If the players ask
how one would find an alchemist, Claudia tells them they should ask
Ulrike or Trudeberg and she quickly sketches out a solution in her
notebook: travel to some place, find an alchemist, talk to them about
their apprentice, solve some sort of problem, come back, secure a
place, organise the town folks to build that house, contact three
different fay creatures and the devil to get the first four weird
ingredients. If players actually go and do the first step, Claudia
prepares the next two steps for upcoming sessions. If the players
change plans, Claudia adapts her sketch. She tries to stay ahead of
the game and her sketch has some adventure bones ready to improvise.

Do the players solve problems by talking? A local complains about the
bandits again. If the players ask about the origin of the bandits or
their leader, Claudia tells them to speak to Krimhild or Waltrud and
she quickly sketches out a solution in her notebook: travel to a
village nearby where relatives of bandits live and talk to them, meet
bandits and talk to them, return and talk to a person of authority,
broker a deal. Maybe she looks at this and thinks it needs a
complication. Lord Obersaxo wants to recruit the bandits, too. This
leads to looting and the authorities look the other way. Maybe a third
party can be convinced to intervene.

As you can see, the sketch of the solution to a long term goal is a
sequence of tasks that the players may or may not pursue. It’s OK for
players not to pursue or abandon these goals. No harm done, Claudia
didn’t prepare too far ahead. If goals are abandoned, Claudia is free
to narrate an ending she likes. If the players didn’t organise an
alchemist, perhaps the complaints reach the ears of Lord Obersaxo and
an alchemist settles in the castle of Brugg downriver, outside the
player character’s current sphere of influence. Complications can
arise!

If players do not want to abandon a goal, Claudia makes sure there are
always non-player characters around to give advice and point at the
next task (or offer an interesting choice). The interesting choices
arise when there are multiple goals that need completion, or when
trouble has to be left brewing elsewhere in order to get closer to the
goal. This is frustrating for players but also important for them to
prove to themselves how important their goals are. How far are they
willing to go for what they believe in?

Some ideas: stop an ongoing war; prevent a war from breaking out; get
rich during the war (yikes!); build a wall, a castle, a bridge, a mill
or a dam; fight against cruel lords and ladies and overthrow the
government; end serfdom; run a revolution; fight evil wizards and
witches; hunt monsters like shapeshifters and devils; kill a nightmare
demigod; explore the underworld and reach a plane of spiders and
mushrooms, or of fire devils and ancient nobility, or of an endless
prisons full of confused wardens and victims.

### Building a castle

Years later, Brunhilde wants build a castle. She can’t buy a castle,
so how is she going to build it? Let there be a non-player manager, a
famous Construction-5 castle builder called Osgrim. He makes the plans
and spares Alex, Berta and Claudia the details. He just makes demands.
He tells Adalric and Brunhilde what he needs.

*Marble*. The castle needs marble from foreign lands. Do the players
know how to get there? Travel there by ship? Face pirates, cheating
merchants, bandits, find a stowaway? There is no payment for the
marble but a promise of marriage for the marble quarry owner. The
player characters are bringing pictures and a negotiator to the table.
The negotiator is a difficult person but if they are befriended,
Adalric or Brunhilde might have a connection to find a partner of
their own. What kind of partner are they looking for? What about the
quarry owner’s family? Will they let themselves fall in love, risk the
mission and make a big career ending move – for their heart’s desire?
As always, daydreaming and questions are the guide for Claudia. She
prepares the bones adventures and then people play to find out.

*Mines.* There’s a problem in the freestone cavern. Somebody has to go
there, figure what’s wrong and solve it: Maybe it is a werewolf has
been killing miners, or dwarves have shown up from below and demanded
that the digging stop. Why is that? And what about the robber knight
and his mercenaries that promised to return and sack the mining town
unless the protection money is paid are you going to do something
about it? Perhaps the mine operator has been replaced by a
shapechanger who loves to drink fine and eat piglets every day, a
dozen eggs and more, with expensive spices from foreign lands, all
paid for by the resources of the mine, or so they say. Adalric and
Brunhilde can find out and Alex and Berta get to decide how much
violence they are willing to apply in order to find a solution
agreeable to Lord Obersaxo. Have the miners broken into an ancient
grave site and seen the dead sorcerers stirring? Calm the miners and
have them return to work. So many ideas!

*Quarry*. The quarry is in uproar. Kobolds have been pranking the poor
sods, stealing their clothes, filling their tents with spiders, having
their meat rot away. Can Adalric find the invisible flying pranksters,
these cursed fairies, and can he put and end to their antics? They
hate the hammering, the chisels are grating on their ears and the iron
saws are turning the milk sour. Can Brunhilde set the necessary traps?
Can the players catch the kobolds and force them to sign a contract
that banishes them for a year and a day, time enough to finish that
castle?

*Logging*. The loggers refuse to work. Wild men have been spotted.
Giants, they say. Or was it hairy beast men, naked and armed with
clubs? The Alder King is sending them, they say. Is it true? Who is
the Alder King? Do the spider goblin knights from the deep hills fight
for him? Is the troll on his side? Can Adalric and Brunhilde stop them
all? Can they make their way to the Alder King and take those long
stairs leading down to the goblin market? Do they know the rules
governing that place?

### Family

Claudia says, “Krimlind, the daughter of Krimhild, addresses you:
‘Adalric, you have returned and I am glad. These cold halls cannot
wait to hear your laughter again, and neither can I.’ Behind her, you
see her mother, watching you.”

Alex says, “Uh, you honour my, mylady…”

Claudia says, “She blushes and quickly says, ‘oh no, fair Adalric,
please do not call me so. My mother Krimhild rules this court and I am
but a maiden here.’ Her mother smiles and gets up, ‘Come now, child.
Leave us. We want to talk to our messenger. Sit, Adalric, and tell us
about Lord Obersaxo and what he has to said about the bandits.’”

Berta says, “Yeah, we’ll tell her all about that treacherous warmonger
who is recruiting the bandits and letting their brethren plunder the
upper valley for fear of losing them again.”

Claudia says, “Krimhild is not pleased, that’s for sure. You discuss
the situation. She’s worried but it seems you can help her. Is there
anything you want to get from this discussion?”

Alex says, “Actually, can I get some time with Krimlind? She seems
interested in Adalric.”

Claudia says, “How about rolling Intelligence + Culture or Status +
Behaviour to get that? If you do, you’re granted half an hour but
there’s a lady-in-waiting in the garden with you. If you fail, you’re
overstepping.”

Alex says, “My Status is 3, so I’m still an outsider, here. I’ll go
for Intelligence + Culture, which I don’t have. My Intelligence is 9.”

Claudia says, “You need to know how to talk to nobility, so there’s a
-2 penalty. Roll 7 or lower. Also, if you do roll a seven, Krimhild
lets you in to her secret plans.”

Alex says, “All right, I rolled a 5!”

Claudia says, “Sure enough, after a while Krimhild says, ‘All right,
enough for today. Adalric, why don’t you tell my daughter all about
Lord Obersaxo in the garden while Brunhilde and I discuss the matter
of Mayor Hellung, a suspected werewolf.”

Intimacy requires vulnerability. It’s OK if non-player characters make
opening moves, be it parents, children or match-makers. Intimacy can
be awkward at the table and everybody has their own approach. Claudia
did bring up “Lines & Veils” at the beginning of the game – what are
the lines people don’t want to cross and what are the things that are
hinted at but not shown. Alex and Berta didn’t know what was coming so
it wasn’t easy to answer. Alex knew he doesn’t like cruelty and
torture. Berta didn’t want sexual violence and didn’t want to flirt at
the table. So now is the time moment, where Alex and Claudia need to
come to a quick understanding of how far they want to take the scene
in the garden.

Alex says, “The lady-in-waiting is still there, right? We’re not going
to do anything indecent, that’s for sure. Adalric does pluck a sword
lily on the way…”

## Adapting the game

The simplest changes, mechanically, would be to change the list of
talents. Pick a theme, decide upon careers, imagine the rolls you want
to make. Focus on character actions where outcomes need a random
component.

For a science fiction game like Dune: People like Sardaukar and Fremen
need Fight talents: Swords, Knives, Bolters, Unarmed. Is the use of
Shields or Battledress something to roll for? Are there characters
that don’t know how to use shields? Perhaps it’s better to just assume
that without Shields you’re a soft target and bolters deal 5d6 damage.

Would it make sense to bring mentats on adventure? Is that like
bringing librarians to the dungeon? Can you outcompute your opponents?
If the management of estates is important, skills like Calculation,
Logistics, Management and Production are required.

If Production covers both agriculture and industry the game is all
about producing things, managing the employees, bringing the products
to markets, profit margins – interfering with it, rising in the ranks
because you’ve won a battle of logistics. Is this interesting? Maybe
if there is a connection to mercenary companies doing assaults. Again,
Logistics could determine the quality of the outfit, or the quantity
of gear available at the drop zone. Management would determine how far
enemies can penetrate into your hold before security realises what’s
going on.

Supernatural talents are fascinating because they remind us that we’re
free to indulge our fantasy. The presence of supernatural talents
makes sure that the rest of the game isn’t mundane. So Manipulation to
control others, Discipline to stand terrible suffering, Etiquette to
behave appropriately. Is Warp a talent that characters have or is
faster-than-light travel something that just happens, under the
control of huge intelligent ships? Maybe there can be simpler
applications of Warp: It breaks a human mind. It’s similar to
Manipulation but corrupt. Do the Bene Gesserit use Manipulation or
Warp? Interesting question!

Find names for these careers: Lancer for martial activity, Bureaucrat
for economic activity, Disciple for the supernatural?

Is prospecting something characters do? Do people find things? Do poor
people scrounge for stuff? Perhaps an interesting dynamic: The talent
is called Scrounge for city dwellers, Forage for loners, and Resources
for the upper class. You could have all three, or just one. Having
separate skills means people used to forage in the wilderness don’t
automatically get to scrounge for stuff in cities.

Don’t think too hard about adding more mechanics for armour or special
rules for weapons. Optimising such numbers is a separate
entertainment. Similarly, as soon as there’s an equipment lists
players wonder about buying and selling things. There are plenty of
games that do this. Just think of Traveller or D&D. It’s better to
keep the mechanics different.

## Adapting the setting

Alex, Berta and Claudia played the default game: villages along
rivers, towns ruling over lakes, inhospitable mountains where giants
and dragons rule, weird creatures that roam the forests and swamps –
but now Alderic and Brunhilde followed that trail left by the giant
Schattenschmied and lost themselves in Myrkheim, the realm of frogs,
spiders and fungi. What to do?

Figure out what the major civilised factions are. Are there fancy
weapons? New magic talents? Name some creatures. Roll up some stats.
Think of some surface tensions. Think of some secrets to learn. Draw a
map. Create name lists, non-player characters, locations.

The goblin kings. Small kings over warrens and labyrinths. Some of
them are funny furry creatures but others are cruel. Wolfmen. Hairy
creatures with carnivore teeth. Hunters, prone to attack if you show
fear, and they can smell fear. Mykonoids. Slow moving creatures with
strong mental powers. Circles of power. Nagas. Earth demons.
Half-snakes.

The creatures here use spears and knives, there’s no need for extra
weapons. Some magic spells would need replacing: Bureaucracy → Thorns,
the magic of growing thorns out of everything; People → Thoughts, to
be more generic; Fusion → Fungi, since we don’t care about chimeras
all that much down here but we do care about mykonoids; Plants →
Blood, the evil power of gaining power by drinking blood. Maybe that’s
it? Some talents just need a new focus: Animals is mostly spiders,
worms, flies; Sleep is also about dreams, nightmares, paralysis.

As for monster stats, just roll for Nightlings, Predators, Undead,
like you usually would. Magic talents are usually set at 7–9 and
aren’t added to Intelligence or Education as those attributes don’t
exist for monsters.

**Ghouls**: Damage-7 Endurance-12 Life-11 Attack-8 Hit-11 Escape-4,
Shapeshift-7, relentless, bloodthirsty. **Goblins**: Damage-3
Endurance-2 Life-6 Attack-5 Hit-6 Escape-8, weak, cautious.
**Spiders**: Damage-6 Endurance-11 Life-5 Attack-6 Hit-8 Escape-3,
intelligent, tough ambush predators. **Mykonoids**: Damage-6
Endurance-4 Life-2 Attack-5 Hit-7 Escape-4, Sleep-9, collectivist
dreamers. **Wolfmen**: Damage-9 Endurance-7 Life-8 Attack-8 Hit-11
Escape-3, deadly monster, brutal hunters. **Naga**: Damage-7
Endurance-9 Life-12 Attack-6 Hit-7 Escape-4, Charm-8, Shapeshift-9,
Sleep-7, Thoughts-8, sly. **Fire giants**: Damage-19 Endurance-33
Life-6 Attack-6 Hit-13 Escape-4, Fire-7, Transmutation-7.

Surface tensions: The ghoul empire is spreading. The goblins are
everywhere, fleeing the ghouls, cute and funny, but also spies and
kidnappers. The fungal forests are home to myconoids, and in the dark
corners are wolfmen. Old night elf cities still exist, half abandoned.
They cannot fight the ghouls and must fall back. Spider knights.
Desperate dwarves.

Beneath all that: What undead blood sorcery unifies the ghouls? Who
can wake the nagas from their isolation? The numbing power of the
Mushroom Father. Why are the night elves an all female society? What
about wolfmen? What divides the dwarves?

## Adapting adventures

Alderic and Brunhilde are lost in Myrkheim. Claudia starts wondering
about the two. Is Alderic going to learn some of the underworld magic
talents? We need potential teachers, each with some sort of challenge
to overcome.

**Thorns**: A mad devil in a labyrinth of hedges, served by spiders
and goblins (see previous section for stats); blind satyrs stalking
the passages, with stolen eyes. **Satyrs**: Damage-11 Endurance-1
Life-4 Attack-6 Hit-10 Escape-8; a terrible mental torrent of
corrupting transmutation if all their eyes focus on you. But they
don’t have enough Endurance for a second blast. **Thorn devil**:
Damage-7 Endurance-11 Life-10 Attack-9 Hit-12 Escape-2; Thorn-5.
Thorny hedges dealing 1d6 damage to anybody pushing through; thorn
trees spear anybody passing by for 2d6; death by impalement for 5d6
against a single target.

**Fungi**: How do you reach the Shroom King in the Dreamlands? Sink
into the Maggot Sea, loose your first two eyes in order to open that
third one, follow the Spore Trail, regrow your eyes once you reach the
Obelisk of Change. Exchange memories of love for power of colours.
Gain access to yellow, green and red and open the Gate of Rot and
Rebirth. Claudia is throwing out words and seeing what sticks. It’s
all images right now, but there must be a first encounter with
myconids so that Alderic can learn of the Shroom King and the Maggot
Sea.

As for Brunhilde with her werewolf experience, would she want to learn
the secrets of the wolfmen? Claudia starts thinking of a chain of
secrets. She remembers that Berta didn’t want any sexual violence, so
the link between wolfmen and elf women must be something else. An
ancient betrayal, perhaps. In the old days, Myrkheim did have
moonlight, but it was captured in shining crystals by the elves,
plunging the world into darkness, earning the name Myrkheim, the home
of darkness. And without moonlight, the lycanthropy of men spread
wider, no longer turning into madness and bloodlust on nights of the
full moon but infiltrating the soul of every man, every day. The chain
of secrets would therefore be: The wolfmen are filled by inexplicable
rage → the homes of elves are filled with inexplicable peace → wolfmen
cannot approach elf homes without succumbing to uncontrollable rage →
the names of the elves that captured all the moonlight → the fortress
built on top of the moon lake, binding it. Tearing down this fortress
and freeing the moon would be a worthy goal indeed. The plight of
lycanthropes would remain, however.

Claudia wants a second plot line that ties in with fungi and thinks of
giant flies feasting on fungi and the flies being protected by the
toad priests of Tsathoggua. What are the fungi going to do? They take
their grievances to the Naga of Darkest Night, a snake spirit who
controls goblin assassins, spider sorcerers and shape-shifting ghouls.
And so a slow war starts.

To link the threads, Claudia decides that the elves resent the naga
making its moves and they start blocking its agents. The goblin
assassins put pressure on the labyrinth goblins so the devil starts
opposing the naga. Does that mean, the elves and the devil are now on
the same side? Let’s play to find out!
