## What are we even doing?

You have a super simple RPG in front of you. All you need are some
friends and two regular six-sided dice, maybe some pen and paper, and
you're good to go. One of you will referee the game. Is that you? All
other players think up a person. The referee dreams up a world and
situations for these imaginary people; the players say how they react
and the referee says how the world reacts, and so it goes on and on.
The story of these people is our story.

The dice are rolled when something with exciting consequences happens
and we want to leave the outcome to chance. Do our people succeed in
their project or not? And what happens afterwards?

## Character Creation

If you are a player, you play a fictional person, your character. We
will now create this together.

First you choose your name, then you roll your attributes. You have
six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence,
Education, and Status. Roll two six-sided dice for each attribute, add
them together (short: 2d6) and write it down.

> Example: Alex names his character Adalric and rolls 8 8 7 9 10
> 8; Berta names her character Brunhilde and rolls 10 6 9 5 4 4.

Your character begins at age 16. Now you choose a first career. The
choices are Warrior, Mage, or Rapscallion. The process is always the
same: when you begin a new career, make a test to see if it suits you;
get an automatic talent if it does, learn talents, possibly suffer a
twist of fate and grow older by four years. And then you have to
decide if your character continues in the same career for another four
years, with no more suitability test and no automatic skill; or if you
use one year to change careers, risking a new test of suitability, but
also getting a new automatic skill; or if your character is ready for
a life of adventure.

Depending on the career, certain attributes are advantageous. Warriors
need Strength or Endurance, Mages need Intelligence or Education, and
Rapscallions need Dexterity or Status.

If your character isn't suited for the desired career, that career can
no longer be selected. When there are no more careers to choose from,
the adventurous life begins: roll on the reward table for each career!

A career lasts for four years. Each year, choose one of your career
charts and roll 1d6. Write down that talent with a value of 1, or
increase the value if you learn a talent again. When you learn
"", choose a weapon instead: knife, spear, halberd, épée, bow,
lance.

With every career your character completes, the chance for a twist of
fate increases. Thus it makes perfect sense to stop character
generation at some point and to start adventuring.

If your character is 36 or older at the end of a career, you'll need
to check for physical decline. If an attribute falls to zero, the
character dies.

| 1d6 |     Aging Table |
|:---:|----------------:|
| 1   |     Strength -1 |
| 2   |    Dexterity -1 |
| 3   |    Endurance -1 |
| 4   | Intelligence -1 |
| 5   |          Lucky! |
| 6   |          Lucky! |

## Warrior Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Strength or Endurance (your choice). You
automatically learn -1 if you pass. If you don't, you realize
that killing people is brutal and cold and you are not.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength 10 and Berta rolls 2. Brunhilde is
> accepted!

You spend four years as a Warrior and learn something every year. Each
year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6. You may only
roll on the "Officer" table if your character is 20 or older.

| 1d6 |    Mercenary |        Guard |   Rider |     Officer |
|:---:|-------------:|-------------:|--------:|------------:|
| 1   | Construction |  Bureaucracy |    Ride |    Literacy |
| 2   |          Run |   Discipline |    Sing | Bureaucracy |
| 3   |      Tactics | Construction | Tactics |     Tactics |
| 4   |    First Aid |        Brawl |     Spy |   Diplomacy |
| 5   |        Craft |         Brew | Culture |    Behavior |
| 6   |        Fight |        Fight |   Fight |       Fight |

> Example: Berta chooses 2× Mercenary, 2× Guard, and rolls 3 2 5 1,
> resulting in Tactics-1, Run-1, Brew-1, and Bureaucracy-1.
> And Fight-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤ Strength or
Endurance (your choice) to avoid consequences. Otherwise, you
determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: The campaign was a success. For three days you
   plundered. The survivors will never forgive you for your actions.
2. Siege: Malnutrition has aged you prematurely. Roll on the aging
   table.
3. Campaign: You were ambushed and badly injured. Roll on the aging
   table.
4. Lame: After an accident, things never went back to the way they
   used to be. The Warrior career is now denied to you.
5. Captivity: The campaign was a fiasco. You have been captured. Roll
   on the aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to
   escape. If you don't succeed, another four years pass. Roll on the
   aging table again and keep trying to escape – until you succeed or
   die.
6. Lost: The campaign was a big mistake. The army was crushed. The
   fleeing were ridden down. You were never seen again.

> Example: Berta rolls 4+0 and Brunhilde does not suffer a twist of
> fate. Brunhilde is now 20 years old. The aging table does not have
> to be rolled yet.

## Mage Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Intelligence or Education (your choice).
You automatically learn Literacy-1 if you pass. If you don't, you
realize that you don't want to spend the years of your short life in
dusty libraries studying old books.

> Example: Adalric has Education-9 and Alex rolls 9. Adalric is
> accepted!

You spend four years as a Mage and learn something every year. Each
year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6.

| 1d6 | Aggressive | Passive | Manipulative | Transgressive |
|:---:|-----------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| 1   |       Fire |    Heal |        Charm |    Shapeshift |
| 2   |        Air |   Sleep |         Sing |    Necromancy |
| 3   |      Water |    Eyes |    Diplomacy | Transmutation |
| 4   |      Earth |   Doors |     Illusion |        Fusion |
| 5   |      Storm |  Plants |       People |       Animals |
| 6   |      Fight |    Brew |     Literacy |    Planeswalk |

> Example: Alex chooses 2× Aggressive, 2× Manipulative, and rolls 5 3
> 5 2, resulting in Storm-1, Water-1, People-1, and Sing-1. And
> Literacy-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤
Intelligence or Education (your choice) to avoid consequences.
Otherwise, you determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: You exposed a classmate. You will never be forgiven
   for that.
2. Failure: The experiment went wrong and the energy found a way
   through your body. Roll on the aging table.
3. Crossing borders: Research has taken you to places that cannot be
   unseen again. A demon *saw* you and will find you.
4. Trespass: You ventured too far into the space between the worlds
   and almost lost your mind. The Mage career is now denied to you.
5. Lost: You have traveled to foreign worlds and lost yourself there.
   Roll on the aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to
   find your way back. If this is not successful, another four years
   pass. Roll again on the aging table and try again – until you
   succeed or die.
6. A Sacrifice: The rift between the planes was too big, the energy
   uncontrollable, your friends were almost lost – but then you
   sacrificed yourself. Those who know the place know where to find
   you, but your screams are not for the faint of heart.

> Example: Alex rolls 4+0 and Adalric does not suffer a twist of fate.
> Adalric is now 20 years old. The aging table does not have to be
> rolled yet.

## Rapscallion Career

**Suitability**: Roll 2d6 ≤ Dexterity or Status (your choice). You
automatically learn Run-1 if you pass. If you don't, you realize
that you can't bear the endless talks, the tiresome reports, the lies
and the deceit.

> Example: Adalric changes careers (so he is now 21 years old) and
> wants to become a Rapscallion; he has Status 10 and Alex rolls 7.
> Adalric is accepted!

You spend four years as a Rapscallion and learn something every year.
Each year choose one of the following tables and roll 1d6.

| 1d6 |    Thief |      Thug |        Liar |  Murderer |
|:---:|---------:|----------:|------------:|----------:|
| 1   |    Sneak |     Fight |     Culture |     Fight |
| 2   |      Spy |     Craft |    Behavior |      Brew |
| 3   |      Run |       Run | Bureaucracy | First Aid |
| 4   |    Climb | First Aid |    Literacy |     Sneak |
| 5   | Distract |   Tactics |     Oratory |  Behavior |
| 6   |     Pick |      Sing |       Trade |    Tinker |

> Example: Alex chooses 1× Thief, 3× Murderer, and rolls 6 2 2 6,
> resulting in Pick-1, Brew-2, Tinker-1. And Run-1!

**Twist of Fate**: Roll 2d6 + number of previous careers ≤
Dexterity or Status (your choice) to avoid consequences.
Otherwise, you determine the consequences with 1d6.

1. Mortal Enemy: You have humiliated your rival. He or she will never
   forgive you for that.
2. Debt: Your plan didn't work out. On the contrary, you have been
   tricked and now you owe someone more money than you can ever pay
   back.
3. Pulled in: You've accepted help from people, gotten more and more
   entangled, and now you owe them more than just a favor.
4. Caught: You were caught and pilloried. Everyone knows your face.
   The Rapscallion career is now denied to you.
5. Imprisonment: The plan has been blown. You got caught. Roll on the
   aging table. Roll 3d6 ≤ an attribute of your choice to escape. If
   this fails, another four years pass. Roll again on the aging table
   and try again – until you succeed or die.
6. Disappeared: There was a gang war and you disappeared. They say the
   street dogs have gotten fat this year.

> Example: Alex rolls 8+1 because he already has a career as a Mage
> behind him. Adalric suffers no twist of fate and is now 25 years
> old.

## Talents

Roll checks as follows: 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent. On very hard tests,
roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent. If no talent fits, or the matching
talent is missing, then roll 2d6 ≤ attribute +0. A +1 talent is good
enough to do it for a living. Sometimes the lack of a talent
disqualifies you from even trying (a lack of magic talents, for
example).

The chance of rolling a target number or less on 2d6:

| 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | 11    | 12    |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 3%   | 8%   | 17%  | 28%   | 42%   | 58%   | 72%   | 83%   | 92%   | 97%   | 100%  |
| 1/36 | 3/36 | 6/36 | 10/36 | 15/36 | 21/36 | 26/36 | 30/36 | 33/36 | 35/36 | 36/36 |

## Reward

Before you start the adventurous life, there is one more reward. Roll
for each career on the appropriate table.

| 1d6 |         Warrior |            Mage |     Rapscallion |
|:---:|----------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| 1   | Intelligence +1 | Intelligence +2 | Intelligence +1 |
| 2   |    Education +2 |   Education + 1 |    Education +2 |
| 3   |       Status +1 |       Status +2 |       Status +2 |
| 4   |  Secret Society |  Secret Society |  Secret Society |
| 5   |           Horse |       Companion |             Dog |
| 6   |            Land |           Chair |            Post |

> Example: Adalric has had two careers, 1× Mage and 1× Rapscallion.
> Alex rolls 4 5, resulting in membership in a secret society and a
> dog.

**Secret Society**: The referee offers three societies to choose
from. If necessary, these are the three:

* The Ministry of the Evening Light
* The Siblings of the Dawn Treader
* The Descendants of the Frost Giants

**Companion**: A young human who has not made any careers, or an
intelligent animal such as a cat, an owl, or a raven. If human, name

3d6; Life 2d6.

**Horse**: A loyal mount that requires care and feeding. Damage 3d6;
Endurance 6d6; Life 3d6.

**Land**: A piece of land in the wilderness that has been granted to
you. Taking possession of said land is up to you however. Name your
piece of land.

**Chair**: You are welcome in your magic school and can come back at
any time to teach the young magicians something. Name your sponsor.

**Posts**: There is always a vacancy for you in your town, be it in
your gang or in the administration. Name your sponsor.

## Dice Rolls and Combat

If you want to do something and the outcome is uncertain, discuss with
the referee an attribute and a talent to use, provided there is a
suitable match. Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If it's very
hard, you might have to roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent.

Combat is divided into rounds. Everyone may attack, cast magic, or do
something else once per round. All participants announce their action
and roll the dice. Everything happens at the same time so it is
possible for two opponents to take each other out in the same round.

When an advantage is gained through tactics, the result is often a
surprise round where the opponent cannot strike back.

If you attack successfully, you deal 2d6 damage unless you use a
halberd. This deals 3d6 damage. You can only attack as many times in a
fight as you have Endurance.

When you are hit for the first time in a fight, you must subtract the
damage from a random physical attribute. Roll 1d6: 1–2 is Strength,
3–4 is Dexterity, 5–6 is Endurance. For all other hits, you may
distribute the hit dice yourself among the three physical attributes.
You must subtract any carryover from another physical attribute.

If one of your attributes drops to 0, you are slightly injured and
pass out. After 10 minutes you wake up again.

> Example: Brunhilde has Strength-10, Dexterity-6, Endurance-9. She
> gets hit for the first time and has to subtract 4+5=9 damage. Berta
> rolls a 1, so Brunhilde must subtract 9 from Strength (10-9=1). She
> won’t pass out! The second time she has to subtract 2+6=8 hits and
> chooses to subtract 2 from Dexterity (6-2=4) and 6 from Endurance
> (9-6=3). Now it’s getting close…

After the fight, all attributes recover half of the missing amount
(round down). If you are being treated by First Aid or a healer, you
are fit again in 30 minutes, otherwise the recovery takes 3 days.

> Example: After being treated with First Aid, she recovers.
> Brunhilde’s attributes: Strength 1+4½=5, Dexterity 4+1=5, Endurance
> 3+3=6.

If two of your attributes drop to 0, you are severely wounded and pass
out. You don’t wake up again for 3h and only the attributes from 0
recover to 1. With First Aid-3 or Heal-3 you can recover in an
infirmary in 5d6 days, otherwise you die.

If three of your attributes drop to 0, you die.

Expect to see half the participants down or dying after the first
round. War is terrible. Try to avoid it.

### Other creatures

For all other creatures there are only Endurance and Life instead of
the known six attributes. When Endurance drops to 0, they faint; when
Life drops to 0, they die.

> Example: Adalric’s dog Tix has Endurance 3d6, Life 2d6. Alex rolls
> 1+4+5=10 and 5+2=7 and writes down 10/7 for the dog.

### Armour

Hitting opponents wearing a metal cuirass is hard: roll 3d6 ≤
attribute + talent. The reason metal cuirasses are so rare is that
they are so hard to make. They are kept in armories for times of war.
You only put them on when marching into battle. They slow you down
when plundering and when fleeing; they are cumbersome to carry around
and they give you sores. Soldiers do not like wearing them.

### Summary of the rules

Task resolution: Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If it’s
very hard, you might have to roll 3d6 ≤ attribute + talent. If you do
not have the talent, then roll 2d6 ≤ attribute - 2.

Combat: Roll 2d6 ≤ attribute + weapon to hit. If you do, you deal 2d6
damage unless you use a halberd. This deals 3d6 damage. You can only
attack as many times as you have Endurance.

When you are first hit in a fight, you must subtract the damage from a
random physical attribute. Roll 1d6: 1–2 is Strength, 3–4 is
Dexterity, 5–6 is Endurance. For all other hits, you may distribute
the hit dice yourself among the three physical attributes. You must
subtract any carryover from another physical attribute (Strength,
Dexterity or Endurance).

If one of your attributes drops to 0, you are lightly wounded and pass
out. If two of your attributes drop to 0, you are mortally wounded and
you’ll die unless you are treated by somebody with First Aid-3 or
Heal-3. If three of your attributes drop to 0, you die.

## Opponents

All other chapters in this book are intended for the referee. So for you!

People can be depicted with the well-known six attributes. You may
choose these freely or roll them (2d6). Talents are also freely
determined (often 1 or 2).

Monsters and animals have different characteristics that describe
their behavior: damage determines how much damage they deal if they
hit; endurance determines how many rounds they will fight and how much
damage they can take; if it drops to zero, they faint; excess damage
is substracted from life; if it drops to zero, they are mortally
wounded; attack determines whether they attack in an encounter (2d6 ≤
attack); hit determines how well they hit (2d6 ≤ hit), and escape
determines if they attempt to escape when they're not attacking (2d6 ≤
escape). If they neither attack nor escape, we talk.

| 1d6 |  Opponents | Damage | Endurance | Life | Attack | Hit   | Escape |
|:---:|-----------:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| 1   | Nightlings | 2d6    | 1d6       | 1d6  | 1d6+4  | 1d6+5 | 1d6+3  |
| 2   |  Predators | 2d6    | 3d6       | 2d6  | 1d6+5  | 1d6+6 | 1d6+2  |
| 3   |     Undead | 2d6    | 3d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+6  | 1d6+7 | 1d6+0  |
| 4   |     Mounts | 3d6    | 6d6       | 3d6  | 1d6+4  | 1d6+4 | 1d6+2  |
| 5   |     Giants | 4d6    | 8d6       | 4d6  | 1d6+3  | 1d6+8 | 1d6+0  |
| 6   |    Dragons | 6d6    | 10d6      | 5d6  | 1d6+2  | 1d6+9 | 1d6+0  |

For each world, the stats will be slightly different. Note down when
you roll something and stick to it! For the number of enemies, roll
2d6 for nightlings and predators, or 1d6 for undead. Giants and
dragons are always loners.

> Example: Claudia referees the game and needs goblins that
> ride on giant spiders that ambush the vanguard. There are 7.
> She uses the line of nightlings and mounts. Goblins:
> Damage-3, Endurance-1, Life-5, Fight-5, Attack-9, Escape-4.
> Giant Spiders: Damage-15, Endurance-16, Life-12, Fight-9,
> Attack-5, Escape-7. In this world, goblins are rather harmless
> opponents who ride on terrible giant spiders, which,
> oddly enough, are not very good at hitting things.

Always announce impending danger clearly, so that the players can
decide for themselves whether they want to engage in a fight.

> Example: Claudia describes how the car-sized shadows
> push through the undergrowth, how their acrid smell spreads
> and the animals in the barn panic.

If possible, the players should roll the dice, not the referee. For
example, if they want to lure the opponent into an ambush, or notice
an ambush, someone should roll against Intelligence + Tactics in both
cases.

## Magic

Just like you slowly build up a pool of enemies, you need to work out
an understanding of just how powerful magic is with the players.

> Example: How many goblins can Adalric kill with lightning? Alex and
> Claudia agree that lightning can hit a giant spider including its
> rider, doing 5d6 damage to each, or chain lightning can hit five
> goblins, doing 2d6 damage to each.

The same applies here: Make a note of what you negotiate and stick to
it!

> **Lightning**: hits an enemy and what they are carrying for 5d6 damage each  
> **Chain Lightning**: hits up to 5 enemies for 2d6 damage each

Spells can be stronger than weapon attacks but spell casting is not
limited by Endurance. Instead, the risk of exhaustion increases with
each spell cast. When casting spells, roll 2d6 + number of spells cast
today ≤ attribute + talent to succeed. If the check fails, this
particular talent can no longer be used today.

> Example: Adalric conjures rain for privacy. He has Intelligence-9,
> Water-1, for a total of 10. Alex rolls 4+6=10 + 0 since this was the

Magic always leads to discussions. You have to like that – otherwise
you should skip the Mage career. How long can you breathe underwater?
Can you do magic underwater? What happens when you cast lightning
underwater? The important thing is to agree at the table and to write
down the result.

Not all magic talents are equally powerful, or equally useful. You
also have to live with that. Certain magic talents lend themselves to
druids, bards, healers, necromancers, elementalists and seers. It’s up
players to find an interesting use for their talents and it is up to
the referee to enable such situation.

### Some notes on particular spell effects

*Summon*. There is no talent to summon demons or elementals.
Instead, use planeshifting and subjugate some demons in person.

*Charm*. Being forced into doing things you don’t want to do is
nauseating and revolting. When the magic ends, the anger starts.

*Prophecy*. It is not possible to foresee the future. A role-playing
game is not a saga; fate is not predetermined.
