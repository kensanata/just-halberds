# Myrkheim

<p class="title"><img src="images/Frogling.jpg" alt="A frog person with a sort of spear."/></p>

## Introduction

This is a setting for a short campaign of *Knives* or *Halberts*. The
travellers left the realm of Midgard, the middle realm where humans
live, and they ended up here in Myrkheim – and no way back. The world
is plunged in eternal night, deep underground. Spiders, fungi,
goblins, elves, dwarves, froglings, ghouls and evil sorcerors are
constantly at each other's throat. Can you find the way back home?

## Encounters

Random encounters are important. Every day and every night not spent
behind walls, roll 1d6. On a 1, roll on the following table:
