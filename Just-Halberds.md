## What is this?

This is a super simple role-playing game using just two six sided dice
(2d6). One person is the referee (you?) and your friends play
characters in an imagined world. The referee imagines the setting and
the situations these characters come across, your friends say how the
characters they are playing react, the referee says how the setting
reacts, and on it goes. The story of these characters is your story.

The dice come into play when something of consequence is going to
happen and you want to leave the outcome to chance. Whenever people
struggle, you'd roll dice. Do they succeed or do they fail? And what
are the consequences going to be?

## Making characters

Each player needs to make a character in the game. This is the person
they control.

1. a name
2. an occupation
3. a particular skill
4. a special ability

An occupation is something general that anybody can do. What did you
do before embarking on adventure? A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a
spy? A particular skill is something you have trained well and that
other people know you for: sword fighting, hunting, singing. A special
ability is something you have learned from a master in the game: a
spell, a special technique.

After every game session, the referee may pick one character and grant
them a new skill or a new special ability, depending on the events
that took place. If you kept trying to punch people, you might have
learned the boxing skill. If you asked the elves to teach you a song,
you might get the special ability to sing their song of sadness. If
you asked the treasure hunter to teach you a new spell, you might
learn how to shoot icicles from your fingertips.

## Rolling dice

The player and the referee both roll two six sided dice (2d6). The
player's roll indicates how well they did and the referee's roll
indicates how hard it was. If the player rolls higher, they win; if
the referee rolls higher, they fail; if they roll the same number,
something new and unexpected happens.

When you roll your dice, add one for every profession, skill and
special ability that applies. If you're Fo Pi, the fist-fighting
fire-mage shooting fire bolts from your palms (profession:
*fire-mage*; skill: *fist-fighting*; special ability: *fire bolt*)
then you might get to add one for being a fire-mage and one for
shooting a fire bolt in a fight. When the orcs are grappling you,
however, you might just get to add one for fist-fighting.

Similarly, the referee might add one to the roll if you're punching
the orcs, or the referee might add two to the roll if you're fighting
their boss, or even three if the boss is wielding a magic mace; or the
referee might add nothing at all to the roll if they're being hit by
fire bolts because they don't know how to deal with it.

The effect of your actions are going to be decided by the referee.
Feel free to negotiate, but don't overdo it. Keep the game flowing and
roll with the punches. I promise it's going to be an entertaining game
even if – and specially if – you have to suffer the occasional
setback.

## Hits

Character are heroes. They can take three hits.

- Light armour grant an extra hit but prevent spell casting.

- Heavy armour grants two extra hits but prevents spell casting,
  sneaking, climbing, running, and swimming.

- A shield grants an extra hit and also prevents spell casting,
  sneaking, climbing, running, and swimming.

Thus, a spell caster without armour can take three hits. A thief in
light armour can take four hits. A warrior in full gear can take six
hits.

When you're rolling dice, the losing side usually takes damage:

- If the difference is small (say one or two), this is one hit.

- If the difference is big (say three or four), this is two hits.

- If the difference is huge (five or more), this is three hits. Apply
  extra effects if possible.

- If you're down to two hits, you've taken a beating.

- If you're down to one hits, you're injured and that prevents you from
  doing anything strenuous.

- If you're down to zero hits, you're down and out. If your enemies
  want to kill you, they can. Recovery takes many days.

## Initiative

Whoever acts first has the initiative. When you land a hit, you keep
the initiative and determine who goes next. This continues until the
defenders get a better result.

Example: Fo Pi the fire-mage is fighting some orcs. The orcs are
surprised and so Fo Pi's player gets to say what Fo Pi does. Fo Pi is
going to fire bolt the orcs. If Fo Pi misses, the orcs get the
initiative. They decide to grapple Fo Pi. Thus, the side with
initiative determines what gets used in the attack and this constrains
what gets used in the defence. Fire-magic and fire bolts are not going
to be of much use against a bunch of grappling orcs, for example.

## Agreeing on results

When rolling dice, the profession, skill and special abilities used by
both sides don't just add to the rolls, they also determine what
happens in the game. The exact results are determined at the table.

Let us return to Fo Pi, the fist-fighting fire-mage shooting a fire
bolt at five orcs. You roll a seven and add two, so your result is
nine. The orcs also roll a seven but don't get to add anything because
they hate magic. There is a difference of two. What does it mean?

*There's an clap; there's fire; an orc is flying backwards. He's not
getting back up. He's dead.*

Fo Pi's player might think that the fire bolt ought to kill them all
and challenges the result. Here's why I think one dead is good enough:

- The difference between the two results was small. It's worth one
  hit. Orcs have one hit in my game. One dead is fair.

- Fo Pi is a newbie mage. A mighty fire-mage might have used a more
  powerful spell like a fire ball. The fire bolt having a minor effect
  is appropriate.

- I'm picturing Fo Pi's fire bolt like a simple bolt of fire, about as
  powerful as a superb kick from a distance.

If players argue that they think it should be a huge explosion
instead, ask the other people at the table. Do they think that's fair?
How about the players of fighters and thieves, do they agree? Is there
some other limit on the use of fire bolts? Agree on what the special
effect does and continue playing. The next time you run into a similar
situation, you'll remember and there won't be a discussion.

## How good are opponents?

It depends. When they have the initiative, opponents attack with their
strong abilities. Don't add anything for thugs, add one for dangerous
opponents, add two for people with special training, add *three* for
bosses, maybe (rarely!) add *four* if they have a magic weapon.

When players have the initiative and attack the opponents' weak spots,
don't add as much.

When fighting ghouls in their underground tunnels, for example, they
project an aura of fear, in addition to being dangerous with the sharp
teeth and their long nails: add two. If players use fire spells
against them, don't add anything to their roll. They aren't good at
defending against it.

## Example opponents from my campaign

As you can see in the list below, it's not always about fighting.
Bureaucrats make life difficult for you, bards make fun of you,
bandits blackmail you. When looking at the numbers, remember that this
is their best skill. If bandits add one when threatening people, they
probably don't add anything when you beat them up. When boars add one
as they charge, they probably don't add anything when they're engaged.

In the list below, regular people have one hit where as terrible
monsters have up to ten hits. Prepare for a long fight!

* bandits ♡, +1 when threatening, blackmailing, ambushing, hiding
* bards ♡, +2 when singing and dancing, telling stories and mocking people
* basilisks ♡♡♡♡♡♡, +3 due to their *poisonous miasma*

## Example spells from my campaign

These spells are based on the monster list above and some elemental
magic. A ☆ marks the more powerful spells. Learning them should be a
reward from somebody in the game.

* *air bending* controls the air flow in your vicinity (smell, spores, poison)
* *air surf* allows you to surf through the air for a few minutes
* *aura of fear* ☆ prevents opponents nearby from acting against you
* *charm* makes others act like your best friends using your voice (and revulsion, later)
* *domination* ☆ forces an opponent to obey your orders (and pure hatred, later)
* *dragon breath* ☆ burns down an entire village; anybody who cannot run must die
* *fire ball* ☆ causes a small explosion on a surface you can see, throwing people around
* *fire bolt* hits an opponent you can see and sets things on fire
* *fire breath* ☆ sets somebody nearby on fire, dealing continuous damage
* *flaming weapon* turns an ordinary weapon into a flaming +1 weapon, for a fight
* *hail of stones* raises nearby pebbles and stones and throws them at a target
* *icicle* hits an opponent you can see but needs water to turn into ice
* *poisonous miasma* ☆ poisons an entire village and those that cannot leave must die
* *sea of flames* sets everything around you on fire, dealing damage to all who stay
* *strangulation* lifts somebody up and keeps hurting them
* *talk to animals* enables you to speak to all the animals around you
* *wave* requires a source of water and magnifies it in order to wash away anything

Perhaps it's more interesting to consider how I adjudicate some of the
spells.

Spells that change what willing targets can do just work, like *air surf*.

Spells that change what unwilling targets can do, like *charm*, have
an effect based on the difference of the roll: one or two is the bare
minimum, like the victim agreeing to some course of action and being
reluctant about it; three or four is the full effect, like the victim
being charmed and doing the thing like a friend would; five or more is
a decisive effect, like the victim being a loyal friend for a day or a
week, depending on how gullible they are.

Spells that can conceivably deal damage, deal damage. A spell like
*wave* bashes an opponent, dealing damage, and washes them away when
the difference is five or more, or if the opponent is out of hits.

Spells that don't deal damage require you to have and lose the
initiative (no roll required) when used in combat, like the *flaming
weapon*. It's better to cast these spells before combat begins,
obviously.

Spells that affect multiple people at the same time involve all of
them rolling their dice and comparing their result to the result of
the spell caster. So when Fo Pi casts a *fire ball*, all the orcs in the
target area need to roll. If they roll less than the fire-mage, they
take damage.

## Other example special abilities from my campaign

Not everybody is a spell caster. What sort of special abilities do
they have?

* *guard* allows you to protect another person and rolling in their
  stead
* *hardy* is the consequence of enduring many defeats: add one ♡
