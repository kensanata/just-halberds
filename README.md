# Just Halberds

This is my short and simple 2d6 system, inspired by
Norbert G. Matausch's
[https://darkwormcolt.blogspot.com/p/landshut-rules.html Landshut Rules],
the interview he did with Bob Meyer on
[https://darkwormcolt.blogspot.com/2020/03/ancient-school-roleplaying-exclusive.html Ancient-School Roleplaying],
and very simple *Dungeon World* alternatives like
[https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/World%20of%20Dungeons%20(black%20&%20white).pdf World of Dungeons]
(including [https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/Wold%20of%20Dungeons%20(Deutsch).pdf the German translation of World of Dungeons]).
