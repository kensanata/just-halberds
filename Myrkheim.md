Myrkheim
========

Myrkheim is a realm of darkness.

If you can find [The Crown of Darkness](#X), you could be the next
ruler of this realm. If you can unite the dwarf families, you could
bring back peace and prosperity. If you can help the nagas to restore
life and stem the tide of undeath, you could find strong allies for
your own struggles elsewhere.

The stats are for
[Halberts](https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/Halberts.pdf), where you start
with a fully formed character, or
[Knives](https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/Knives.pdf), where you start with
no talents and are expected to work your way up, gaining a point every
year. Think of it as some sort of *Fantasy Traveller* with attributes
usually in the 2--12 range.

Random Tunnel Encounters {#random}
------------------------

Roll on this table when time crawls. Roll on this table when an ordinary
encounter drags. Roll on this table when the players are eager for
action.

Monster stats: Roll 2d6 ≤ attributes for checks. Note that monsters
don't use attribute + talent for checks like player characters do.
*Special* is an extra attribute, possibly magical. The exact effects are
to be negotiated. *Numbers* is the number of creatures encountered.
Check *Attack* to see whether they want to fight. If not, check *Escape*
to see if they want to retreat. If not, they want to talk. In a fight,
check *Hit* to see if they land a hit. If so, check *Damage* to see how
much damage they deal. If they are hit, *Endurance* is how much damage
they can take and stay conscious, as well as the number of attacks they
can make. *Life* is how much damage they can recover from. If it runs
out, they die.

The Garden of Peace {#A}
-------------------

A huge cavern was dug, a subterranean church. Blue light is filtering
through the haze above. It cannot be daylight, and it's not moon light.
Something glows coldly, up there. Huge chains dangle from ancient
cranes, creaking softly. Below them, the ground is black and red for
rust and iron deposits. Piles of wreckage, faintly iluminated. And
there, humanoids with long tails and spears. Salamanders.

> Dabābu Kīnu the Honest and their followers: Number-10 Attack-6
> Escape-7 Hit-10 Damage-6 Endurance-3 Life-1

Their large black eyes don't blink, don't move. It's hard to tell what
they are looking at.

> Dabābu Kīnu the Honest says: "Do you know these machines? Do such
> machines exist where you come from?"

From here, tunnels lead to [The Last Pazuzu Shrine](#F), [The Sunken
Grave](#G) and [The Maggots of the Earth](#B).

The Maggots of the Earth {#B}
------------------------

The ceiling recedes up into the darkness and there are niches along the
walls and further up, too. In each niche there is a statue looking down
on you. The graves of a dead civilisation. The deep resting places of a
people that no longer survives on the surface. There are no new dead to
arrive from above. There's only you. As you look up, you notice
movement. Ghouls.

> Ardanānu the Phantom and their followers: Number-5 Attack-7 Escape-4
> Hit-9 Damage-9 Endurance-12 Life-14 Necromancy-7

If you stop, they'll ask you to come up.

> Ardanānu the Phantom says: "You want eternal life but no love? You
> want a kingdom but no light? Everything we once loved has turned to
> dust. Our hearts are dry. No matter how much blood we drink, they can
> never be filled again."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Garden of Peace](#A), [The Many-legged
Shaft](#I) and [The Great Market](#C).

The Great Market {#C}
----------------

The hollering and shouting of goblins is hard to miss. A rift is up
ahead and they have built their rickety bridges across the emptiness. If
you fall, you'll probably be caught by spiders webs or die in a tar pit.

The rift itself is filled by small capsules secured to each other and to
the walls by a thousand thrumming ropes. In this cordage the goblins
move about like sailors in an endless rigging.

> Bēlu Dami the King Killer and their followers: Number-8 Attack-6
> Escape-7 Hit-10 Damage-6 Endurance-6 Life-2 Sneaking-4 Tactics-7

The stench of rotting carcasses hangs in the air. Goblins on large bats
are riding the warm air that rises from below.

> Goblin bats: Number-6 Attack-8 Escape-8 Hit-7 Damage-6 Endurance-6
> Life-4

They are hunting flies as large as cats.

> Bēlu Dami the King Killer says: "We are the maggots of the earth. If
> something lies fallow, we occupy it. If something goes to waste, we
> take it. This place is a shithole and we are its masters!" There is
> much laughter.

From here, tunnels lead to [The Shrine of the Serpent King](#D), [The
Maggots of the Earth](#B) and [The Long Crawlies of Cannibals](#K).

The Shrine of the Serpent King {#D}
------------------------------

Braziers filled with green fire illuminate a pyramid. Stairs lead up to
a seven-headed snake statue. This is Set.

At the foot of the pyramid are statues of snakelings, one after another.
An endless procession of heroes and dignitaries long forgotten.

> Palḫu the Terror and other snakelings: Number-5 Attack-5 Escape-6
> Hit-10 Damage-11 Endurance-3 Life-2 Brewing-6 Charm-7

They serve death and revenge.

> Palḫu the Terror says: "May your enemies rot in hell. May your
> competitors die young. May the plague eat their children."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Shrine for the Prince of Dreams](#E),
[The Water Lake](#M) and [The Great Market](#C).

The Shrine for the Prince of Dreams {#E}
-----------------------------------

In this cavern stands a giant statue of a creature with the beak of a
vulture, claws for hands and feet, large insect eyes and four large
wings on its back. This is Pazuzu, an ancient demon lord associated with
the plague.

At it's feet stands a dwarf fortress. Strong walls to protect against
anybody on foot, long spikes to protect against anybody on wings. Light
burns in watch towers.

> Jórunn the dwarf and their followers: Number-8 Attack-6 Escape-9 Hit-7
> Damage-8 Endurance-5 Life-1 Bureaucracy-8 Culture-9 Diplomacy-5 First
> Aid-5 Spying-10

If there's ever a problem, the dwarves have trained war bears with
strange beaks to protect them.

> Beak Bears: Number-8 Attack-8 Escape-4 Hit-8 Damage-3 Endurance-8
> Life-12

The dwarves are here to spread the dominion of their demon lord.

> Jórunn says: "These lands used to belong to newts and toads. We are
> draining the swamp. We bring clarity of purpose. We are going to make
> Myrkheim great again."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Cemetery of Despair](#O), [The Last
Pazuzu Shrine](#F) and [The Shrine of the Serpent King](#D).

The Last Pazuzu Shrine {#F}
----------------------

In this cavern stands a giant statue of a creature with the beak of a
vulture, claws for hands and feet, large insect eyes and four large
wings on its back. This is Pazuzu, an ancient demon lord associated with
the plague.

At it's feet stands a dwarf fortress. Strong walls to protect against
anybody on foot, long spikes to protect against anybody on wings. Light
burns in watch towers.

> Sólvá the dwarf and their followers: Number-3 Attack-9 Escape-4 Hit-7
> Damage-9 Endurance-5 Life-3 Brewing-7 Craft-6 Discipline-10 Singing-6

From here, tunnels lead to [The Refuge of Silence](#Q), [The Shrine for
the Prince of Dreams](#E) and [The Garden of Peace](#A).

The Sunken Grave {#G}
----------------

Ancient water-filled halls, domed arches, alcoves with orange light
pointing up, reflections dancing on the water's surface. Rows of columns
support ceilings. Stairs rise up and lead to benches. This looks like an
ancient cistern, bath or a flooded temple. Except that in the water
below, newts are moving about.

> Muṣârānu the Healer and their followers: Number-6 Attack-9 Escape-9
> Hit-8 Damage-4 Endurance-3 Life-6

A few newts stand motionless, unblinking, staring over the water. The
waves lapping at their feet dance an orange glow.

> Muṣârānu the Healer says: "Did you know that all these tunnels were
> once filled with water? Who drained them all? Who built the dams and
> drains that destroyed our world? It was the dwarves who dug and built
> their maggot hives."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Shrine for the Prince of the
Underworld](#R), [The Garden of Peace](#A) and [The Altar of the Great
Deceiver](#H).

The Altar of the Great Deceiver {#H}
-------------------------------

In this cavern stands a giant obsidian throne with a hairy pot bellied
and horned goat man. This is Orcus, the old trickster god that cheated
death itself. He can bring back the dead and animate their bones. There
are in fact countless skeletons dancing, illuminated by sulphur light.

Around the throne is a labyrinth of bones. Huge rib cages with bone
houses inside. Pyramids of skulls. Walls made of giant bones. Sharpend
femurs to prevent landings.

> Eina the dwarf and their followers: Number-5 Attack-10 Escape-6 Hit-7
> Damage-7 Endurance-4 Life-2 Bureaucracy-9 Culture-12 Discipline-8
> First Aid-8 Necromancy-4

Whenever a stranger approaches, the skeletons stop their dancing and
their skulls begin to track you.

> Dancing Bones: Number-10 Attack-10 Escape-7 Hit-10 Damage-5
> Endurance-6 Life-4

The congregation is made up of old dwarves. These dwarves are so old
their hair is thinning out.

> Eina says: "Death has cheated me of a good life. I had a family. The
> plague took them all. Now they suffer in Niflheim under the watchful
> eyes of Hel. But we're going to bring them back. Just you wait."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Sunken Grave](#G), [The Dark
Reservoir](#S) and [The Many-legged Shaft](#I).

The Many-legged Shaft {#I}
---------------------

A web funnel spun on charred stone walls. Mummified victims are
interspersed with silk sacks full of water for fire protection. This den
won't be burnt twice.

> Spider: Number-1 Attack-11 Escape-6 Hit-8 Damage-7 Endurance-12
> Life-12

From here, tunnels lead to [The Maggots of the Earth](#B), [The Altar of
the Great Deceiver](#H) and [The Caves of Night](#J).

The Caves of Night {#J}
------------------

The passages have been dug by goblins and dwarves. First, you stoop.
Then you crawl. On your ellbows and belly, sliding between wet stones,
pulling bags on ropes after you, trusting the signs, praying that you
never get stuck.

You pass crushed doors made of stone. Behind the debris are collapsed
tunnels. In those tunnels, the graves of a forgotten people. And you
know what happens to the bones of the aggrieved. They animate.

> Mâtu the Killer and their followers: Number-5 Attack-7 Escape-4 Hit-10
> Damage-2 Endurance-7 Life-21 Necromancy-3

It is impossible to make this right. Who in their right mind would want
to help you rebury all the dead?

If the encounter drags, roll up a second party on the [random encounter
table for tunnels](#random).

From here, tunnels lead to [The Many-legged Shaft](#I), [The Long
Crawlies of Cannibals](#K) and [The Ten Thousand Guardians](#T).

The Long Crawlies of Cannibals {#K}
------------------------------

The passages have been dug by goblins and dwarves. First, you stoop.
Then you crawl. On your ellbows and belly, sliding between wet stones,
pulling bags on ropes after you, trusting the signs, praying that you
never get stuck.

You hear a voice, reciting something. A poem? Humans! Nobody else is
known to recite poetry.

> Warin and their feral followers: Number-7 Attack-8 Escape-3 Hit-6
> Damage-4 Endurance-5 Life-7 Oratory-6 Singing-7 Climbing-5

They have posted guards.

> Warin says: "What brings you here? Have you seen any temples worth
> looting?"

If the encounter drags, roll up a second party on the [random encounter
table for tunnels](#random).

From here, tunnels lead to [The Great Market](#C), [The Shrine at the
Fork](#L) and [The Caves of Night](#J).

The Shrine at the Fork {#L}
----------------------

A dark cavern opens before you. A fortress lies here, defended by long
iron needles embedded into the walls. All approaches are guarded by
malevolent red-glowing eyes.

This is a dwarf fortress. A grim high priest of Hecate protects all
travellers with a bitter grin.

> Vindalf the dwarf and their followers: Number-11 Attack-6 Escape-7
> Hit-8 Damage-7 Endurance-5 Life-4 Bureaucracy-4 Craft-9 Diplomacy-11
> Singing-2 Eyes-11

They have hell hounds to support them.

> Hell hounds: Number-11 Attack-7 Escape-3 Hit-9 Damage-11 Endurance-9
> Life-8 Fire-5

What they value most is the safety of travellers.

> Vindalf says: "The roads must be safe. Spiders must be eliminated. The
> wheel turns. Their time has come."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Water Lake](#M), [The Baths of
Delight](#U) and [The Long Crawlies of Cannibals](#K).

The Water Lake {#M}
--------------

Ancient water-filled halls, domed arches, alcoves with orange light
pointing up, reflections dancing on the water's surface. Rows of columns
support ceilings. Stairs rise up and lead to benches. This looks like an
ancient cistern, bath or a flooded temple. Except that in the water
below, newts are moving about.

> Pirinzaḫu the True and their followers: Number-9 Attack-8 Escape-4
> Hit-7 Damage-5 Endurance-6 Life-3

Some newts are standing in a stone circle. Drops of orange light float
gently from monolith to monolith.

> Pirinzaḫu the True says: "We were the first to settle Myrkheim. We
> were here before the dwarves came. We will still be here when the
> dwarves are gone. This is our realm."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Home of the Spider Knights](#N), [The
Shrine of the Serpent King](#D) and [The Shrine at the Fork](#L).

The Home of the Spider Knights {#N}
------------------------------

There are rifts in Myrkheim. Gaps as deep as mountains. This one here
goes down at an angle.

The rift itself is filled by small capsules secured to each other and to
the walls by a thousand thrumming ropes. In this cordage the goblins
move about like sailors in an endless rigging.

> Muneḫḫu the Subduer and their followers: Number-8 Attack-7 Escape-9
> Hit-7 Damage-7 Endurance-1 Life-4 Sneaking-6 Tactics-10

There is much jeering and shouting on the hanging bridges. Stones and
feces is being flung.

> Muneḫḫu the Subduer says: "Have you come to learn from the master?
> Have you come to lick my toes?"

From here, tunnels lead to [The Cemetery of Despair](#O), [The Great
Net](#V) and [The Water Lake](#M).

The Cemetery of Despair {#O}
-----------------------

The ceiling recedes up into the darkness and there are niches along the
walls and further up, too. In each niche there is a statue looking down
on you. The graves of a dead civilisation. The deep resting places of a
people that no longer survives on the surface. There are no new dead to
arrive from above. There's only you. As you look up, you notice
movement. Ghouls.

> Miqittu the Carcass Eater and their followers: Number-5 Attack-10
> Escape-4 Hit-12 Damage-6 Endurance-10 Life-12 Necromancy-9

If you stop, they'll ask you to come up.

> Miqittu the Carcass Eater says: "You want eternal life but no love?
> You want a kingdom but no light? Everything we once loved has turned
> to dust. Our hearts are dry. No matter how much blood we drink, they
> can never be filled again."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Tunnels of Entrails](#P), [The Home of
the Spider Knights](#N) and [The Shrine for the Prince of Dreams](#E).

The Tunnels of Entrails {#P}
-----------------------

Everything is under water. Movement is slow. If you slip, you might
drown. You move carefully. If only you could see the ground.

A sweet perfume fills the air. So sweet. So strong.

The air is heavy now, inhale the intoxicating scent feel the world go
out of focus.

And then, the colours. Iridescent colours, kaleidoscopic transitions,
fractal patterns turning, falling, crawling.

Finally, the giant moth hanging on the wall, its wings opening and
closing, prismatic lights dancing on the walls. The illusions of friends
and family, crying children. Your loved ones coming back from the
afterlife.

> Warp moth: Number-1 Attack-9 Escape-5 Hit-8 Damage-10 Endurance-10
> Life-4 Charm-7 Illusion-7

It is only later that you see all the skulls and bones lying below it.

If the encounter drags, roll up a second party on the [random encounter
table for tunnels](#random).

From here, tunnels lead to [The Resting Place of Kings](#W), [The Refuge
of Silence](#Q) and [The Cemetery of Despair](#O).

The Refuge of Silence {#Q}
---------------------

A cavern houses a lake with an ancient frog temple built of stone.
Stairs lead into the water. There are orange lights glowing along the
stairs and atop the temple. Salamanders can be seen moving about.

> Kitturru the Toad Face and their followers: Number-8 Attack-8 Escape-5
> Hit-7 Damage-5 Endurance-3 Life-1

You are being watched.

> Kitturru the Toad Face says: "At the bottom of this lake sleeps an eye
> tyrant. See those eyes bubbling up? When the tyrant is agitated, there
> are more of them. Lately, the eyes that surface are decaying and dead.
> They used to float around and watch what was going on. I think the
> tyrant is dying."

It's true. At the bottom of the lake sleeps a sick Eye Tyrant. It is
surrounded by hundreds of skeletons. These are the remains of ancient
rites.

> Eye Tyrant: Number-1 Attack-5 Escape-7 Hit-8 Damage-9 Endurance-11
> Life-11 Charm-6 Eyes-8 Transmutation-8

From here, tunnels lead to [The Tunnels of Entrails](#P), [The Last
Pazuzu Shrine](#F) and [The Shrine for the Prince of the
Underworld](#R).

The Shrine for the Prince of the Underworld {#R}
-------------------------------------------

In this cavern stands a giant obsidian throne with a hairy pot bellied
and horned goat man. This is Orcus, the old trickster god that cheated
death itself. He can bring back the dead and animate their bones. There
are in fact countless skeletons dancing, illuminated by sulphur light.

Around the throne is a labyrinth of bones. Huge rib cages with bone

their skulls begin to track you.

> Dancing Bones: Number-5 Attack-9 Escape-5 Hit-8 Damage-6 Endurance-1

The congregation is made up of old dwarves. These dwarves are so old
their hair is thinning out.

> Kára says: "The dead do not rest for Orcus has given them the power of
> movement. With movement comes action. With action comes
> responsibility. Unfortunately, with life does not come wisdom. That is
> still up to us."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Refuge of Silence](#Q), [The Curse of
the Old One](#X) and [The Sunken Grave](#G).

The Dark Reservoir {#S}
------------------

Huge boulders lie here, and between the boulders, the water-filled
cracks go deep. In the blackness below, pale creatures cling to the
walls. These are olms. Cave salamanders with external gills. They don't
seem to be interested in coming up to the surface.

> Napāšu the Breath of Life and their followers: Number-11 Attack-8
> Escape-9 Hit-6 Damage-8 Endurance-6 Life-2

A few newts stand motionless, unblinking, staring over the water. The
waves lapping at their feet dance an orange glow.

> Napāšu the Breath of Life says: "Did you know that all these tunnels
> were once filled with water? Who drained them all? Who built the dams
> and drains that destroyed our world? It was the dwarves who dug and
> built their maggot hives."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Shrine for the Prince of the
Underworld](#H).

The Ten Thousand Guardians {#T}
--------------------------

There is a lake at the bottom of a deep pit and within it beats a heart
of light. If you look down from above it looks like the green eye of a
forest in spring, like leaves. Tiny waterfalls drizzle into the abyss as
the trail winds itself down, round and round, deeper and deeper.

In the middle of the lake grows a tumor of wood, leaves, flowers, reeds,
root, illuminated by glowing bugs and worms. Light spills into this
world as if through a tear in the fabric of the realm. It is so unreal.

This is the Olm Court. They stand below the water, in long rows, holding
their spears. Their red gills forming fantastic neck wreaths. They are
guarding their queen.

> Šēḫu the Wind Breather and her followers: Number-6 Attack-8 Escape-9
> Hit-6 Damage-10 Endurance-3 Life-2 Healing-8 Air-4 Water-10

The power of Air is one of the talents one needs to master to gain [The
Crown of Darkness](#X). Here is where you could learn it. This is also
one of the places where you could leave Myrkheim on your own: The Olm
Gate leads to Vanaheim.

From here, a tunnel lead to [The Caves of Night](#J).

The Baths of Delight {#U}
--------------------

The air is warm and there's light up ahead. Soon, glyphs wriggle on the
stone walls spilling lemon light.

There is a cavern with a small waterfall and a little lake. The air is
warm and smells of sweet flowers. Yellow lines shine warm light from
above. Around the lake grow bushes bearing heavy flowers. A short stone
bridge leads to an island.

In the middle of it all stands a wooden temple with open sides. Snake
guardians made of stone stand guard.

> Ašartu the Desert and other nagas: Number-8 Attack-10 Escape-1 Hit-8
> Damage-6 Endurance-12 Life-16 Sleep-4 Culture-6 Earth-8 Plants-9

Big snake people are reading scrolls, playing a flute or meditating. The
intricate patterns on their skin seem to flow as if blown by the softest
breeze. Their living halberts are never far from their hands. Their
unblinking eyes are yellow and blue, with vertical pupils. These are
snake eyes.

> Ašartu the Desert says: "The nagas have kept the rivers and forests
> spirits at bay in Midgard. But now it is us that need your help. We
> need to destroy the evil haunting [The Resting Place of Kings](#W).
> The tide of death must be stopped."

From here, tunnels lead to [The Shrine at the Fork](#L).

The Great Net {#V}
-------------

Greyness filters down from above. The detritus of light sinks to the
bottom every so slowly, reflected a thousand times by dew and spider
silk. The hollow husk of dead smell is all that remains.

The spiders that live in this skyhole are Orb Phase Spiders. Way up,
where the air is thin and the light is stronger, the boundaries between
the realms starts flickering. The Phase Spiders have attuned to this.
This is how they manage to cross over into other realms. It is what
gives them their name.

> Anzūzu the Wise and her followers: Number-8 Attack-6 Escape-6 Hit-10
> Damage-6 Endurance-14 Life-5 Eyes-8 Planeswalk-11 Spying-7

The power of Planeswalk is one of the talents one needs to master to
gain [The Crown of Darkness](#X). Here is where you could learn it. This
is also one of the places where you could leave Myrkheim on your own: by
climbing this shaft for two weeks you can reach Vanaheim.

The Resting Place of Kings {#W}
--------------------------

The entrance to this tomb was blown open, its ancient seals ripped
apart. Beyond it lies cold despair and death. All light dims. The walls
are closing in. As you descend into the necropolis, the number of dry
husks along the walls are piled higher and higher.

Past the Cavern of Bones lies the Throne Room of Death.

An undead army of thousands could be raised, here.

The power of Necromancy is one of the talents one needs to master to
gain [The Crown of Darkness](#X). Here is where you could learn it.

The Curse of the Old One {#X}
------------------------

Beneath the Waterfall of a Thousand Tears lies the Black Pool of Pain.
Down there is the water-filled Cavern of Bones. How these leviathans
came here to die, nobody knows. In this benthic graveyard, with all the
bulk of Myrkheim above you, the boundaries between the realms is
weakened. Gravity flickers. The void groans.

If you managed to bring your own air into the deep, you'll see the
fickle slivers of the phase transition. If you know the secret of
planeswalking, you can stabilize the gate. If you have a ghoul mind, you
can make the transition into the Grave of Nagabbiš.

Here sleeps the Old Master of Myrkheim. Here lies his crown, Agê Uzzu,
the Crown of Wrath. Take it and rule Myrkheim.

> The prerequisites: Master [Air](#T). Master [Planeswalk](#V). Master

Underworld](#R).
